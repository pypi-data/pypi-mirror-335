# Ghga Event Schemas

GHGA Event Schemas: A package that collects schemas used for events exchanged between GHGA service.

## Description

This package contains a collection of Pydantic-based models used to provide type-checked
and validated event schemas.


## Installation

We recommend using the provided Docker container.

A pre-build version is available at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ghga/ghga-event-schemas):
```bash
docker pull ghga/ghga-event-schemas:5.0.0
```

Or you can build the container yourself from the [`./Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile):
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
docker build -t ghga/ghga-event-schemas:5.0.0 .
```

For production-ready deployment, we recommend using Kubernetes, however,
for simple use cases, you could execute the service using docker
on a single server:
```bash
# The entrypoint is preconfigured:
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghga/ghga-event-schemas:5.0.0 --help
```

If you prefer not to use containers, you may install the service from source:
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
pip install .

# To run the service:
ghga_event_schemas --help
```

## Configuration

### Parameters

The service requires the following configuration parameters:
- **`log_level`** *(string)*: The minimum log level to capture. Must be one of: `["CRITICAL", "ERROR", "WARNING", "INFO", "DEBUG", "TRACE"]`. Default: `"INFO"`.

    - *string*

    - *null*


  Examples:

- **`workers`** *(integer)*: Number of workers processes to run. Default: `1`.

- **`api_root_path`** *(string)*: Root path at which the API is reachable. This is relative to the specified host and port. Default: `""`.

- **`openapi_url`** *(string)*: Path to get the openapi specification in JSON format. This is relative to the specified host and port. Default: `"/openapi.json"`.

- **`docs_url`** *(string)*: Path to host the swagger documentation. This is relative to the specified host and port. Default: `"/docs"`.

- **`cors_allowed_origins`**: A list of origins that should be permitted to make cross-origin requests. By default, cross-origin requests are not allowed. You can use ['*'] to allow any origin. Default: `null`.

  - **Any of**

    - *array*

      - **Items** *(string)*

    - *null*


  Examples:

  ```json
  [
      "https://example.org",
      "https://www.example.org"
  ]
  ```


- **`cors_allow_credentials`**: Indicate that cookies should be supported for cross-origin requests. Defaults to False. Also, cors_allowed_origins cannot be set to ['*'] for credentials to be allowed. The origins must be explicitly specified. Default: `null`.

  - **Any of**

    - *boolean*

    - *null*


  Examples:

  ```json
  [
      "https://example.org",
      "https://www.example.org"

  ```


- **`cors_allowed_methods`**: A list of HTTP methods that should be allowed for cross-origin requests. Defaults to ['GET']. You can use ['*'] to allow all standard methods. Default: `null`.

  - **Any of**

    - *array*

      - **Items** *(string)*

    - *null*


  Examples:

  ```json
  [
      "*"
  ]
  ```


- **`cors_allowed_headers`**: A list of HTTP request headers that should be supported for cross-origin requests. Defaults to []. You can use ['*'] to allow all headers. The Accept, Accept-Language, Content-Language and Content-Type headers are always allowed for CORS requests. Default: `null`.

  - **Any of**

    - *array*

      - **Items** *(string)*

    - *null*


  Examples:

  ```json
  []
  ```


- **`generate_correlation_id`** *(boolean)*: A flag, which, if False, will result in an error when inbound requests don't possess a correlation ID. If True, requests without a correlation ID will be assigned a newly generated ID in the correlation ID middleware function. Default: `true`.


  Examples:

  ```json
  true
  ```


  ```json
  false
  ```


- **`language`** *(string)*: The language. Must be one of: `["Greek", "Croatian", "French", "German"]`. Default: `"Croatian"`.


### Usage:

A template YAML for configurating the service can be found at
[`./example-config.yaml`](./example-config.yaml).
Please adapt it, rename it to `.ghga_event_schemas.yaml`, and place it into one of the following locations:
- in the current working directory were you are execute the service (on unix: `./.ghga_event_schemas.yaml`)
- in your home directory (on unix: `~/.ghga_event_schemas.yaml`)

The config yaml will be automatically parsed by the service.

**Important: If you are using containers, the locations refer to paths within the container.**

All parameters mentioned in the [`./example-config.yaml`](./example-config.yaml)
could also be set using environment variables or file secrets.

For naming the environment variables, just prefix the parameter name with `ghga_event_schemas_`,
e.g. for the `host` set an environment variable named `ghga_event_schemas_host`
(you may use both upper or lower cases, however, it is standard to define all env
variables in upper cases).

To using file secrets please refer to the
[corresponding section](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/#secret-support)
of the pydantic documentation.



## Architecture and Design:
<!-- Please provide an overview of the architecture and design of the code base.
Mention anything that deviates from the standard triple hexagonal architecture and
the corresponding structure. -->

This is a Python-based service following the Triple Hexagonal Architecture pattern.
It uses protocol/provider pairs and dependency injection mechanisms provided by the
[hexkit](https://github.com/ghga-de/hexkit) library.


## Development

For setting up the development environment, we rely on the
[devcontainer feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) of VS Code
in combination with Docker Compose.

To use it, you have to have Docker Compose as well as VS Code with its "Remote - Containers"
extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`) installed.
Then open this repository in VS Code and run the command
`Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` from the VS Code "Command Palette".

This will give you a full-fledged, pre-configured development environment including:
- infrastructural dependencies of the service (databases, etc.)
- all relevant VS Code extensions pre-installed
- pre-configured linting and auto-formatting
- a pre-configured debugger
- automatic license-header insertion

Moreover, inside the devcontainer, a convenience commands `dev_install` is available.
It installs the service with all development dependencies, installs pre-commit.

The installation is performed automatically when you build the devcontainer. However,
if you update dependencies in the [`./pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml) or the
[`./requirements-dev.txt`](./requirements-dev.txt), please run it again.
