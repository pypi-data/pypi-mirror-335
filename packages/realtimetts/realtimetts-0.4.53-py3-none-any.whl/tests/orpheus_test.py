      - Load orpheus-3b-0.1-ft-Q8_0-GGUF in Q8_0 quantization
      - Make sure server is running
    
    2. Any other LLM provider:
      - make sure the the server supports completions api
      - load orpheus-3b-0.1-ft-Q8_0-GGUF model in Q8_0 quantization and run the server
      - provide api_url to the server to OrpheusEngine constructor
