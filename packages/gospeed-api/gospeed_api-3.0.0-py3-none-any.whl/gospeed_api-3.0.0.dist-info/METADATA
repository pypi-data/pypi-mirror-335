Every function's input and output will get type checking in runtime by using [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/).

Because in 2.0.2 there is a bug which handle url query parameter incorrectly, cause invoking delete endpoint to delete task and file failure!

And It's already resolved in the newest version! ☝️🤓

## The future improvements were on plan

2025/1/6/

1. After a few months at the end of development, I'm supposed to rewrite the usage guide. Because recently, when I was trying to write some script based on this library, I could feel there was not enough introduction to make things clear for the user.
2. Update to version 3.0.0. This major update will create a new implementation with a more intuitive usage experience.

I'm starting achiving these two objectives from the day I wrote above.
