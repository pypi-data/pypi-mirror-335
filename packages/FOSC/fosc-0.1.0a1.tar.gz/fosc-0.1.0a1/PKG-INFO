# FOSC
A Python version of the Framework for optimal extraction of clusters (FOSC).

> **Note:**
> This is a test version and may contain bugs. If you notice anything wrong, please contact the developers.

## Quick Start Tutorial

This is a tutorial that teaches how to quickly start using the FOSC package.

Considering you have a dataset in a CSV file, start by loading its data.

```python
import numpy as np

mat = np.genfromtxt(file_path, dtype=float, delimiter=',', usecols=range(0, -1), missing_values=np.nan)
```

> **Note:**
>
> Replace `file_path` with your dataset's path.
>
> In this example, the last column represents the cluster to which an object is assigned, according to another algorithm. Since we are using our own method, we ignore the last column with the `usecols` parameter.

Choose the MClSize (minimum cluster size) parameter and the method of linkage:

```python
mclsize = 30
linkage_method = "single"
```

Calculate the distance matrix:

```python
from scipy.spatial import distance_matrix

dist_mat = distance_matrix(mat, mat, p=2)
```

Now, you can instantiate the FOSC object:

```python
from FOSC import FOSC

foscFramework = FOSC(dist_mat, linkage_method, mclsize)
```

And run the FOSC algorithm:

```python
infiniteStability = foscFramework.propagateTree()
partition, lastObjects = foscFramework.findProminentClusters(1, infiniteStability)
```

The partition returned from the `findProminentClusters` method is the result of running the FOSC algorithm, i.e., the cluster extraction.

Finally, you can visualize the results using the functions available in the Plot module:

```python
from FOSC import Plot

Plot.plotDendrogram(foscFramework)
Plot.plotSilhouette(foscFramework, partition)
Plot.plotReachability(foscFramework, partition)
```
