```

## Usage

### Basic Graphic Walker Pane

[![py.cafe](https://py.cafe/badge.svg)](https://py.cafe/snippet/panel/v1#code=https%3A//raw.githubusercontent.com/panel-extensions/panel-graphic-walker/refs/heads/main/examples/reference/basic.py&requirements=panel-graphic-walker%3E%3D0.5.0) [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/source-code-blue)](https://github.com/panel-extensions/panel-graphic-walker/blob/main/examples/reference/basic.py)

Here’s an example of how to create a simple `GraphicWalker` pane:

```python
import pandas as pd
import panel as pn

from panel_gwalker import GraphicWalker

pn.extension()

df = pd.read_csv("https://datasets.holoviz.org/windturbines/v1/windturbines.csv.gz", nrows=10000)

GraphicWalker(df).servable()
```

You can put the code in a file `app.py` and serve it with `panel serve app.py`.

### Setting the Chart Specification

[![py.cafe](https://py.cafe/badge.svg)](https://py.cafe/snippet/panel/v1#code=https%3A//raw.githubusercontent.com/panel-extensions/panel-graphic-walker/refs/heads/main/examples/reference/spec.py&requirements=panel-graphic-walker%3E%3D0.5.0) [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/source-code-blue)](https://github.com/panel-extensions/panel-graphic-walker/blob/main/examples/reference/spec.py)

In the `GraphicWalker` UI, you can save your chart specification as a JSON file. You can then open the `GraphicWalker` with the same `spec`:

```python
GraphicWalker(df, spec="spec.json")
```

![Spec Example](https://github.com/panel-extensions/panel-graphic-walker/blob/main/examples/reference/spec.png)

### Changing the renderer

[![py.cafe](https://py.cafe/badge.svg)](https://py.cafe/snippet/panel/v1#code=https%3A//raw.githubusercontent.com/panel-extensions/panel-graphic-walker/refs/heads/main/examples/reference/renderer.py&requirements=panel-graphic-walker%3E%3D0.5.0) [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/source-code-blue)](https://github.com/panel-extensions/panel-graphic-walker/blob/main/examples/reference/renderer.py)

You may change the `renderer` to one of 'explorer' (default), 'profiler', 'viewer' or 'chart':

```python
GraphicWalker(df, renderer='profiler')
```

### Scaling with Server-Side Computation

[![py.cafe](https://py.cafe/badge.svg)](https://py.cafe/snippet/panel/v1#code=https%3A//raw.githubusercontent.com/panel-extensions/panel-graphic-walker/refs/heads/main/examples/reference/kernel_computation.py&requirements=panel-graphic-walker%5Bkernel%5D%3E%3D0.5.0%0Afastparquet) [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/source-code-blue)](https://github.com/panel-extensions/panel-graphic-walker/blob/main/examples/reference/kernel_computation.py)

In some environments, you may encounter message or client-side data limits. To handle larger datasets, you can offload the *computation* to the *server* or Jupyter *kernel*.

First, you will need to install extra dependencies:

```bash
pip install panel-graphic-walker[kernel]
```

Then you can use server-side computation with `kernel_computation=True`:

```python
walker = GraphicWalker(df, kernel_computation=True)
```

This setup allows your application to manage larger datasets efficiently by leveraging server resources for data processing.

Please note that if running on Pyodide, computations will always take place on the client.

## API

### Parameters

#### Core

- `object` (DataFrame): The data for exploration. Please note that if you update the `object`, the existing chart(s) will not be deleted, and you will have to create a new one manually to use the new dataset.
- `field_specs` (list): Optional specification of fields (columns).
- `spec` (str, dict, list): Optional chart specification as URL, JSON, dict, or list. Can be generated via the `export` method.
- `kernel_computation` (bool): Optional. If True, the computations will take place on the server or in the Jupyter kernel instead of the client to scale to larger datasets. The 'chart' renderer will only work with client side rendering. Default is False.

#### Renderer

- `renderer` (str): How to display the data. One of 'explorer' (default), 'profiler', 'viewer', or 'chart'. These correspond to `GraphicWalker`, `TableWalker`, `GraphicRenderer`, and `PureRender` in the `graphic-walker` React library.
- `container_height` (str): The height of a single chart in the `viewer` or `chart` renderer. For example, '500px' (pixels) or '30vh' (viewport height).
- `hide_profiling` (bool): Whether to hide the profiling part of the 'profiler' renderer. Default is False. Does not apply to other renderers.
- `index` (int | list): Optional index or indices to display. Default is None (all). Only applicable for the `viewer` or `chart` renderer.
- `page_size` (int): The number of rows per page in the table. Only applicable for the `profiler` renderer.
- `tab` ('data' | 'vis'): Set the active tab to 'data' or 'vis' (default). Only applicable for the `explorer` renderer. Not bi-directionally synced.

#### Style

- `appearance` (str): Optional dark mode preference: 'light', 'dark', or 'media'. If not provided, the appearance is derived from `pn.config.theme`.
- `theme_key` (str): Optional chart theme: 'g2' (default), 'streamlit', or 'vega'. If using the [`FastListTemplate`](https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/templates/FastListTemplate.html), try combining the `theme_key` 'g2' with the `accent` color <div style="display:inline;background-color:#5B8FF9;color:white;padding:0 5px;border-radius:3px;">#5B8FF9</div>, or 'streamlit' and <div style="display:inline;background-color:#ff4a4a;color:white;padding:0 5px;border-radius:3px;">#ff4a4a</div>, or 'vega' and <div style="display:inline;background-color:#4c78a8;color:white;padding:0 5px;border-radius:3px;">#4c78a8</div>.

#### Other

- `config` (dict): Optional additional configuration for Graphic Walker. For example `{"i18nLang": "ja-JP"}`. See the [Graphic Walker API](https://github.com/Kanaries/graphic-walker#api) for more details.

### Methods

#### Clone

- `clone`: Clones the `GraphicWalker`. Takes additional keyword arguments. Example: `walker.clone(renderer='profiler', index=1)`.
- `chart`: Clones the `GraphicWalker` and sets `renderer='chart'`. Example: `walker.chart(0)`.
- `explorer`: Clones the `GraphicWalker` and sets `renderer='explorer'`. Example: `walker.explorer(width=400)`.
- `profiler`: Clones the `GraphicWalker` and sets `renderer='profiler'`. Example: `walker.profiler(width=400)`.
- `viewer`: Clones the `GraphicWalker` and sets `renderer='viewer'`. Example: `walker.viewer(width=400)`.

#### Export and Save Methods

- `export_chart`: Returns chart(s) from the frontend exported as either Graphic Walker Chart specification, vega-lite specification or SVG strings.
- `save_chart`: Saves chart(s) from the frontend exported as either Graphic Walker Chart specifications, vega-lite specification or SVG strings.
- `export_controls`: Returns a UI component to export the charts(s) and interactively set `scope`, `mode`, and `timeout` parameters. The `value` parameter will hold the exported spec.
- `save_controls`: Returns a UI component to export and save the chart(s) acting much like `export_controls`.

#### Other Methods

- `add_chart`: Adds a Chart to the explorer from a Graphic Walker Chart specification.
- `calculated_field_specs`: Returns a list of *fields* calculated from the `object`. This is a great starting point if you want to provide custom `field_specs`.

## Vision

Our dream is that this package is super simple to use and supports your use cases:

- Great documentation, including examples.
- Supports your preferred data backend, including Pandas, Polars, and DuckDB.
- Supports persisting and reusing Graphic Walker specifications.
- Scales to even the largest datasets, only limited by your server, cluster, or database.

## Supported Backends

| Name | `kernel_computation=False` | `kernel_computation=True` | Comment |
| ---- | - | - | - |
| Pandas | ✅ | ✅ | |
| Polars | ✅ | ✅ | |
| DuckDB Relation | ✅ | ✅ | |
| Ibis Table | ✅ | ✅ | Too good to be True. Please report feedback. |
| Dask | ✅ | ❌ | [Not supported by Pygwalker](https://github.com/Kanaries/pygwalker/issues/658) |
| Pygwalker Database Connector | ❌ | ❌ | [Not supported by Narwhals](https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals/issues/1289) |

Other backends might be supported if they are supported by both [Narwhals](https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals) and [PygWalker](https://github.com/Kanaries/pygwalker).

Via the [backends](examples/reference/backends.py) example its possible to explore backends. In the [`data` test fixture](tests/conftest.py) you can see which backends we currently test.
