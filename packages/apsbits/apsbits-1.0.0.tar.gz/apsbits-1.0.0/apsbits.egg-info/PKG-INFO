## Installing the BITS Package for Development

```bash
git clone github.com:BCDA-APS/BITS.git
cd BITS
conda create -y -n BITS_env python=3.11 pyepics
conda activate BITS_env
pip install -e ."[all]"
```

## Testing the apsbits base installation

On an ipython console

```py
from apsbits.demo_instrument.startup import *
listobjects()
RE(sim_print_plan())
RE(sim_count_plan())
RE(sim_rel_scan_plan())
```

## Testing

Use this command to run the test suite locally:

```bash
pytest -vvv --lf ./src
```

## Documentation
