A callback for logging training events from Hugging Face's Transformers to [Logfire](https://logfire.sh) ü§ó

## Overview

The `logfire-callback` package provides a seamless integration between Hugging Face's Transformers library and Logfire logging service. It allows you to track and monitor your model training progress, metrics, and events in real-time through Logfire's platform.

## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install logfire-callback
```

## Usage

First, ensure you have a Logfire API token and set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export LOGFIRE_TOKEN=your_logfire_token
```

Then use the callback in your training code:

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
from logfire_callback import LogfireCallback

# Initialize your model, dataset, etc.

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    num_train_epochs=3,
    # ... other training arguments
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    callbacks=[LogfireCallback()]  # Add the Logfire callback here
)

trainer.train()
```

The callback will automatically log:
- Training start with configuration parameters
- Periodic training metrics (loss, learning rate, etc.)
- Evaluation metrics during validation
- Training completion
