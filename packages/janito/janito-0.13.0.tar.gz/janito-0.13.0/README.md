### Setting up your API Key

Janito requires an Anthropic API key to function. You can:
1. Set the API key: `janito --set-api-key your_api_key`

For development or installation from source, please see [README_DEV.md](README_DEV.md).

## 🚀 Usage Tutorial

After installation, you can start using Janito right away. Let's walk through a simple tutorial:

### Getting Started

First, let's check that everything is working:

```bash
# Get help and see available commands
janito --help
```

### Tutorial: Creating a Simple Project

Let's create a simple HTML project with Janito's help:

After installing Janito, using your prefered editor and/or terminal, go to a new empty folder.

Use the janito command to create a new project.

```bash
# Step 1: Create a new project structure
janito "Create a simple HTML page with a calculator and 3 columns with text for the 3 main activities of the Kazakh culture"
```
Browse the resulting html page.

### Tutorial: Adding Features

Now, let's enhance our example

```bash
# Step 2: Add multiplication and division features
janito "Add some svg icons and remove the calculator"

```

Refresh the page

### Exploring More Features

Janito offers many more capabilities:

```bash
# Show detailed token usage and cost information
janito --show-tokens "Explain what is in the project"

# Use a specific parameter profile for creative tasks
janito --profile creative "Write a fun description for our project"

# Use trust mode for concise output without tool details
janito --trust "Optimize the HTML code"
# Or use the short alias
janito -t "Optimize the HTML code"

# Continue the most recent conversation
janito --continue "Please add one more line"

# Continue a specific conversation using its message ID
# (Janito displays the message ID after each conversation)
janito --continue abc123def "Let's refine that code"

# Show current configuration and available profiles
janito --show-config

# You can press Ctrl+C at any time to interrupt a query
# Janito will still display token and tool usage information
# Even interrupted conversations can be continued with --continue
```

## 🔧 Available Tools

Janito comes with several built-in tools:
- 📄 `str_replace_editor` - View, create, and edit files
- 🔎 `find_files` - Find files matching patterns
- 🗑️ `delete_file` - Delete files
- 🔍 `search_text` - Search for text patterns in files
- 🌐 `fetch_webpage` - Fetch and extract content from web pages
- 📋 `move_file` - Move files from one location to another
- 💻 `bash` - Execute bash commands with real-time output display

## 📊 Usage Tracking

Janito includes a comprehensive token usage tracking system that helps you monitor API costs:

- **Basic tracking**: By default, Janito displays a summary of token usage and cost after each query
- **Detailed reporting**: Use the `--show-tokens` flag to see detailed breakdowns including:
  - Input and output token counts
  - Per-tool token usage statistics
  - Precise cost calculations
  - Cache performance metrics with savings analysis
  - Line delta tracking for file modifications

```bash
# Show detailed token usage and cost information
janito --show-tokens "Write a Python function to sort a list"

# Basic usage (shows simplified token usage summary)
janito "Explain Docker containers"

# Use trust mode for concise output without tool details
janito --trust "Create a simple Python script"
# Or use the short alias
janito -t "Create a simple Python script"
```

The usage tracker automatically calculates cache savings, showing you how much you're saving by reusing previous responses.

## 📋 Parameter Profiles

Janito offers predefined parameter profiles to optimize Claude's behavior for different tasks:

- **precise**: Factual answers, documentation, structured data (temperature: 0.2)
- **balanced**: Professional writing, summarization, everyday tasks (temperature: 0.5)
- **conversational**: Natural dialogue, educational content (temperature: 0.7)
- **creative**: Storytelling, brainstorming, marketing copy (temperature: 0.9)
- **technical**: Code generation, debugging, technical problem-solving (temperature: 0.3)

```bash
# Use a specific profile
janito --profile creative "Write a poem about coding"

# View available profiles
janito --show-config
```

## 🔇 Trust Mode

Janito offers a trust mode that suppresses tool outputs for a more concise execution experience:

### How It Works

- When enabled with `--trust` or `-t`, Janito suppresses informational and success messages from tools
- Only essential output and error messages are displayed
- The final result from Claude is still shown in full
- Trust mode is a per-session setting and not saved to your configuration

### Using Trust Mode

```bash
# Enable trust mode with the full flag
janito --trust "Create a Python script that reads a CSV file"

# Or use the short alias
janito -t "Create a Python script that reads a CSV file"
```

This feature is particularly useful for:
- Experienced users who don't need to see every step of the process
- Batch processing or scripting where concise output is preferred
- Focusing on results rather than the process
- Creating cleaner output for documentation or sharing

## 💬 Conversation History

Janito automatically saves your conversation history, allowing you to continue previous discussions:

### How It Works

- Each conversation is saved with a unique message ID in `.janito/last_messages/`
- The most recent conversation is also saved as `.janito/last_message.json` for backward compatibility
- After each conversation, Janito displays the command to continue that specific conversation

### Using the Continue Feature

```bash
# Continue the most recent conversation
janito --continue "Add more details to your previous response"

# Continue a specific conversation using its ID
janito --continue abc123def "Let's modify that code you suggested"
```

The `--continue` flag (or `-c` for short) allows you to:
- Resume the most recent conversation when used without an ID
- Resume a specific conversation when provided with a message ID
- Maintain context across multiple interactions for complex tasks

This feature is particularly useful for:
- Multi-step development tasks
- Iterative code improvements
- Continuing discussions after system interruptions
- Maintaining context when working on complex problems
