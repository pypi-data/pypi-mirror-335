# ImgFixer Documentation

## Overview
ImgFixer is a lightweight FastAPI-based application that scans a given directory and corrects incorrect image file extensions. It determines the actual file type of images and renames them with the correct extension to ensure compatibility and consistency.

## Purpose
Many image files have incorrect or missing extensions, which can cause issues with software that relies on proper file formats. ImgFixer automates the process of verifying and correcting image file extensions, making file management more reliable and efficient.

## Features
- Detects image file formats using content-based identification (not just file extensions).
- Automatically renames files with incorrect extensions to their correct format.
- Provides a web interface for ease of use.
- Supports popular image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and WebP.
