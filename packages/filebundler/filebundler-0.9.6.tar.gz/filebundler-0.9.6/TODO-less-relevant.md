# IGNORE FOR NOW (may become relevant later)
1. display file name in the file tree as they are
  1. at the moment, __init__.py file for example, are shown only as "init.py". Probably because the "__" is used by the markdown as formatting
2. we could provide a Dockerfile
3. [ROADMAP] improve token count: once we have the llm utility with open router we can add a button in the "exports" tab that calculates the amount of tokens in the export using the model that the user chooses
4. [FEATURE] allow the user to modify the order of the files in the bundle
   1. we can do this by adding an "index" value to the FileItem model
   2. but I'm not sure how to best implement the re-ordering in the UI 
   3. drag and drop would be great be appearently this is only possible with a (not very widely used) library
   4. we may be better off making a component ourselves
5. [QOL] refactor state modifications into a "state" folder to better track keys
   1. unnecessary for the moment as we're not using that many keys
   2. as an example, the state logic for auto-bundling is entirely contained in the two files under ui/tabs/auto_bundler
