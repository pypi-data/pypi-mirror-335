NOTE
====

The "denodo" folder does not include a __init__.py in order not to define a module for it.

This allows other denodo.x software packages to exist in the future without a sqlalchemy-only definition
of this "denodo" module in "denodo-sqlalchemy" colliding with the "denodo." namespace of such other future
software packages.

Therefore, the way to import this dialect in python code (rarely needed) would be:

   import denodo.sqlalchemy as denodo_sqlalchemy

Instead of the following (which should fail):

   import denodo
