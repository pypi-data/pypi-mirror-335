# Pyhackrf2 HTime

Pyhackrf2 HTime is an extension of
[Pyhackrf2](https://github.com/eizemazal/pyhackrf2),
a Python wrapper for the C API (library libhackrf) for the HackRF One,
the open-hardware/open-source SDR by
[Great Scott Gadgets](https://www.greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one/).

Pyhackrf2 HTime adds access to the
[HTime extension](https://github.com/fabriziop/hackrf-htime)
functionalities of HackRF One firmware.

The HTime extension provides the HackRF SDR with the
capability to perform timed commands and a precise phase synchronization
of internal clocks (sampling, MCU, output) for the best timing performance.
