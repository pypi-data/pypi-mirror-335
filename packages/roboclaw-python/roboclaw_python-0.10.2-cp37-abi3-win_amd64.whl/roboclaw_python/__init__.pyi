        """
        Several motor and quadrature combinations can be used with RoboClaw. In some cases the default PID values will need to be tuned
        for the systems being driven. This gives greater flexibility in what motor and encoder combinations can be used. The RoboClaw PID
        system consists of four constants starting with QPPS, P = Proportional, I = Integral, D = Derivative. 
        The default values are
        - QPPS: 44000
        - P: 0x00010000
        - I: 0x00008000
        - D: 0x00004000

        QPPS is the speed of the encoder when the motor is at 100% power. P, I, D are the default values used after reset.

        without a quadrature encoder.
