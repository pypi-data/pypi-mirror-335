# Phase 2 Implementation Steps: Function Detection and Change Analysis

This document provides an updated guide for implementing Phase 2 of DiffScope, focusing on integrating function detection and change analysis with the existing code structure.

## Current Progress
- ✅ Basic model structure implemented
- ✅ Basic diff parsing utilities implemented 
- ✅ Function parsing with tree-sitter implemented
- ✅ Function change detection implemented
- ✅ Integration with Phase 1 implemented

```

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed Features
- Basic function detection using tree-sitter
- Function diff extraction from file diffs
- Function change classification (signature/body/docstring)
- Renamed function detection
- Integration with GitHub API from Phase 1
- End-to-end commit analysis workflow

### ⚠️ Needs Additional Work
- Handling more edge cases (anonymous functions, nested functions)
- Improved language support beyond the basic languages
- Performance optimization for large repositories
- More comprehensive error handling and logging

### ❌ Future Enhancements (Post Phase 2)
- Support for additional Git providers beyond GitHub
- Caching of parsed functions for performance
- Support for private repositories with authentication
- Advanced statistical analysis of function-level changes

## Next Implementation Tasks

### 1. Extended Test Coverage
- Add more comprehensive integration tests
- Test with a variety of real-world repositories
- Add benchmarks for performance tracking

### 2. Documentation and Examples
- Create tutorial documentation
- Add example scripts for common use cases
- Document API and data structures

### 3. Command-Line Interface
- Create CLI for direct access to the functionality
- Add JSON output option for integration with other tools
- Implement report generation features

## Integration Architecture

The integration between Phase 1 (GitHub API) and Phase 2 (Function Detection) is now complete:

1. **Phase 1** provides:
   - GitHub API integration
   - Commit metadata retrieval
   - File-level change detection

2. **Phase 2** provides:
   - Function boundary detection with tree-sitter
   - Function change analysis
   - Function-specific diff generation

3. **Integration Layer** connects them:
   - Retrieves file content before and after changes
   - Applies function detection to identify changed functions
   - Aggregates results into a comprehensive analysis object

## API Overview

The main API is now accessible through a simple interface:

```python
from diffscope import analyze_commit

# Analyze a GitHub commit with function-level detail
result = analyze_commit("https://github.com/owner/repo/commit/sha")

# Access the results
for file in result.modified_files:
    print(f"File: {file.filename}, Status: {file.status}")
    
for func in result.modified_functions:
    print(f"Function: {func.name}, Change: {func.change_type}")
    if func.diff:
        print(func.diff)
```

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Installation**: Install the package with dependencies
2. **Configuration**: Set up GitHub token for API access
3. **Basic Usage**: Analyze commits with the main `analyze_commit` function
4. **Advanced Usage**: Explore the detailed function changes in the results
