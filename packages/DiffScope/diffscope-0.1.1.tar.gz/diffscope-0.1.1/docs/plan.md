# DiffScope Development Plan

This document outlines the development strategy for implementing DiffScope, a tool for analyzing function-level changes in Git commits.

## 1. System Architecture

DiffScope will be implemented using a modular architecture with three main components:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌───────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────────┐
│                 │     │                   │     │                         │
│  Git Change     │────>│  Function         │────>│  Function-Level         │
│  Processing     │     │  Boundary         │     │  Change                 │
│                 │     │  Detection        │     │  Identification         │
└─────────────────┘     └───────────────────┘     └─────────────────────────┘
```

While these components will execute sequentially in the final workflow, we'll design them with well-defined interfaces so they can be developed and tested independently.

## 1.1 Simplification Constraints

For the initial version, we will focus on a minimal viable product with the following constraints:

1. **No Repository Cloning**: We will only use Git APIs (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) to analyze repositories without cloning them locally.
2. **Remote Public Repositories Only**: We will only support remote public repositories, not local repositories.
3. **Minimal Error Handling**: We'll implement basic error handling but accept that some edge cases may not be handled in the initial version.
4. **Focus on Core Functionality**: We'll prioritize the core workflow over advanced features or optimizations.
5. **Limited Language Support**: We'll start with 2-3 key languages (Python, JavaScript) and expand later.

These constraints help us deliver a working solution quickly while avoiding over-engineering.

## 2. Module Design

### 2.1 Git Change Processing Module

**Purpose:** Extract raw file changes from Git commits

**Components:**
- Repository handler: Clone/fetch repositories when needed
- Commit retriever: Get specific commits by URL or SHA
- Diff extractor: Extract file-level diffs from commits
- File content extractor: Get before/after versions of changed files

**Input:** Git commit URL or SHA
**Output:** List of `ModifiedFile` objects with file-level changes

### 2.2 Function Boundary Detection Module

**Purpose:** Identify function boundaries in source code files

**Components:**
- Language detector: Determine programming language of files
- Parser factory: Create appropriate parser for each language
- Language-specific parsers: Extract function boundaries
- Function mapper: Map files to their contained functions

**Input:** File content (before and after versions)
**Output:** Function boundaries with metadata (name, start/end lines)

### 2.3 Function-Level Change Identification Module

**Purpose:** Determine which functions changed and how they changed

**Components:**
- Change mapper: Map line changes to function boundaries
- Function differ: Generate function-level diffs
- Change classifier: Determine type of change (added, modified, removed)
- Result formatter: Create structured output of changed functions

**Input:** File changes and function boundaries
**Output:** List of `ModifiedFunction` objects with function-level changes

## 4. Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Each module will have dedicated unit tests
- Mock interfaces between modules
- Test with various language samples and diff scenarios

### Integration Testing
- Test the complete pipeline with real Git repositories
- Include edge cases like merge commits, large diffs
- Test with multiple languages in the same repository

### Performance Testing
- Benchmark processing time for various repository sizes
- Optimize for large diffs and repositories

## 5. Development Approach

### Modular Development
While the modules execute sequentially in the final workflow, we'll develop them with clear interfaces that allow for independent development and testing. This approach has several advantages:

1. **Parallel Development:** Team members can work on different modules simultaneously
2. **Testability:** Each module can be tested in isolation with mock inputs
3. **Flexibility:** Implementation details can change within a module without affecting others
4. **Extensibility:** New language support or Git backends can be added without changing the core logic

### Dependency Management

The modules have these dependencies:

- **Git Change Processing:** External dependency on Git repositories
- **Function Boundary Detection:** Depends on file content from Git Change Processing
- **Function-Level Change Identification:** Depends on outputs from both previous modules

To manage these dependencies during development:

1. Create mock data generators for each module interface
2. Define clear data exchange formats between modules
3. Use dependency injection for module interactions

## 6. Implementation Considerations

### Language Support Strategy
Start with a few widely used languages (Python, JavaScript) and expand to others (Java, C/C++, Go, etc.) in later phases.

### Performance Optimization
- Use lazy loading for repository content
- Process only changed files
- Implement caching for function boundary detection
- Consider parallel processing for large repositories

### Error Handling
- Implement robust error handling at module boundaries
- Gracefully degrade when specific language parsing fails
- Provide helpful error messages for troubleshooting
