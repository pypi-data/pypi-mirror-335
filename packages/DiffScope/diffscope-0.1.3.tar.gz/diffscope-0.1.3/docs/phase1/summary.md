# Phase 1 Implementation Summary

## Completed Components

In Phase 1, we've implemented the following components:

1. **Data Models**
   - `ModifiedFile`: Stores information about a file changed in a commit
   - `ModifiedFunction`: Placeholder for function-level changes (to be populated in Phase 2)
   - `CommitAnalysisResult`: Encapsulates the results of analyzing a commit

2. **GitHub API Client**
   - URL parsing for GitHub commit URLs
   - Commit data retrieval using PyGithub
   - File content extraction at specific commits
   - Error handling for API requests

3. **Git Analyzer**
   - Extraction of file-level changes from commits
   - Conversion of GitHub API data to our data models
   - Basic language detection based on file extensions

4. **Library Interface**
   - Clean, importable API with a single main function `analyze_commit()`
   - Example script to demonstrate usage

## Current Capabilities

The library currently:
- Accepts a GitHub commit URL as input
- Retrieves commit metadata (author, date, message)
- Extracts file-level changes (filename, status, additions, deletions)
- Detects programming language based on file extensions
- Returns a structured data object with all extracted information

## Implementation Notes

- Uses PyGithub for GitHub API interaction rather than direct HTTP requests
- Provides a standardized interface through our own API while leveraging PyGithub's functionality
- Structured to allow for future expansion to other Git providers

## Limitations

Current limitations that will be addressed in future phases:
- Only GitHub is supported, not other Git providers
- Only public repositories are supported, no authentication
- Only file-level changes are detected, not function-level
- Basic language detection only supports common file extensions
- No handling of large repositories or rate limiting (though PyGithub helps with some of these concerns)

## Next Steps

The next phase (Phase 2) will focus on:
- Implementing function boundary detection using Tree-sitter
- Creating language-specific parsers for major languages
- Mapping file changes to functions
- Setting up the infrastructure for function-level diff generation
