# Revised Test Plan: Function Detection and Change Analysis

This document outlines an updated testing strategy for Phase 2 of DiffScope, aligning with the current codebase structure and implementation status.

## Current Test Coverage
- ✅ Basic model tests implemented
- ✅ Function parser tests implemented
- ✅ Diff utilities tests fixed
- ✅ Function detector tests implemented
- ✅ Basic integration tests implemented

## Test Progress and Future Work

### ✅ Completed Tests
- Unit tests for function parsing
- Unit tests for diff utilities
- Unit tests for function change detection
- Basic integration tests for GitHub API interaction
- Basic end-to-end commit analysis tests

### ⚠️ Needs Additional Coverage
- More comprehensive integration tests
- Tests for error handling and edge cases
- Performance testing with larger repositories
- Cross-language function detection tests

### ❌ Future Test Plans
- Benchmark tests for performance tracking
- Regression tests for specific bug fixes
- Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Test with a variety of real-world repositories

## Integration Testing Focus

Our integration testing now focuses on verifying the end-to-end functionality:

1. **GitHub API to Function Detection Pipeline**
   - Test the complete flow from commit URL to function analysis
   - Verify correct function change identification
   - Check that all file types are handled correctly

2. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**
   - Test with malformed commits or URLs
   - Test with large repositories and commits
   - Test with various programming languages and file structures

3. **Real-world Repository Testing**
   - Use actual GitHub repositories for testing
   - Verify results against manual inspection
   - Test repositories with multiple languages

## Testing Tools and Approaches

- **pytest fixtures**: Reusable test data and context
- **Mock objects**: Isolated component testing without API calls
- **Parameterized tests**: Test multiple scenarios efficiently
- **Integration tests**: Verify end-to-end functionality
- **GitHub Actions**: Continuous integration testing

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests
```
python -m pytest tests/unit
```

### Integration Tests
```
# Requires a GitHub token in environment
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
python -m pytest tests/integration
```

### Full Test Suite
```
python -m pytest
```

## Contribution Guidelines for Tests

When adding new features or fixing bugs:

1. **Add test coverage** for the new functionality
2. **Ensure existing tests pass** with your changes
3. **Use descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested
4. **Include edge cases** in your test coverage
5. **Mock external dependencies** for reliable testing

## Next Steps in Testing

1. **Expand integration test cases** for different types of commits
2. **Add more real-world examples** to test against
3. **Implement performance benchmarks** for key functions
4. **Create test coverage report** and aim for high coverage
5. **Automate testing** in continuous integration pipeline
