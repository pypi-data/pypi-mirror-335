# MalloryAI Python SDK

## üöÄ Overview
The official Python SDK for the MalloryAI platform, providing seamless API integration. This SDK simplifies interaction with MalloryAI's services while maintaining high code quality standards and consistent development practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### From PyPI
```sh
pip install malloryai-sdk
```

### For Development
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:malloryai/api-sdk.git
   cd api-sdk
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have `pdm` installed, then:
   ```sh
   pdm install
   ```

3. **Install Development Tools**
   ```sh
   pdm install -dG lint test dev
   ./install-commit-hook.sh
   ```

## üìö Quick Start

```python
from malloryai.sdk.api.v1.api import MalloryIntelligenceClient

# Initialize the client
malloryClient = MalloryIntelligenceClient(api_key="your-api-key")


# Use the SDK
async def main():
   bulletin = await malloryClient.bulletins.list_bulletins(limit=1)
```

## üß™ Development

### Running Tests
```sh
# Run all tests with coverage
pdm run pytest

# Run specific test files
pdm run pytest tests/v1/bulletins/test_bulletins.py
```

### Code Quality
We use several tools to maintain code quality:
- Black for code formatting
- Flake8 for code linting
- Pre-commit hooks for automated checks

Run quality checks manually:
```sh
pdm run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## üì¶ Deployment
The SDK uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment to PyPI. The deployment process is triggered automatically when you push a new version tag.

### Creating a New Release
1. **Update Version**
   Update the version in `pyproject.toml`:
   ```toml
   [project]
   version = "x.y.z"  # Update this
   ```

2. **Create a GitHub Release**
   - Go to the repository's Releases page
   - Click "Draft a new release"
   - Create a new tag (e.g., `vx.y.z`)
   - Fill in the release title and description
   - Click "Publish release"

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
1. Run linting checks
2. Build the package
3. Publish to PyPI using trusted publishing

### Manual Deployment
If needed, you can build and publish manually:
```sh
# Build the package
pdm build

# Publish to PyPI (requires PyPI credentials)
pdm publish
```

## üìù Commit Convention
We follow the Conventional Commits specification for commit messages:

```
<type>(<optional-scope>): <description>
```

### Types
| Type      | Usage |
|-----------|-------|
| `feat`    | New features |
| `fix`     | Bug fixes |
| `docs`    | Documentation changes |
| `style`   | Code style changes (formatting, etc.) |
| `refactor`| Code refactoring |
| `test`    | Adding or modifying tests |
| `chore`   | Maintenance tasks |

### Examples
‚úÖ Good:
```sh
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement async token refresh"
git commit -m "fix: handle connection timeouts properly"
git commit -m "docs: update authentication examples"
```

‚ùå Avoid:
```sh
git commit -m "updated code"
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "wip"
```

## ü§ù Contributing
1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch:
   ```sh

   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests and quality checks:
   ```sh
   pdm run pytest
   pdm run pre-commit run --all-files
   ```
5. Commit your changes following our commit convention
