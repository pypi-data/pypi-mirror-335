Based on the following three documents:

Document 1: {{document_1}}
Document 2: {{document_2}}
Document 3: {{document_3}}

And given these questions:
<questions>{{questions}}</questions>

Write a comprehensive context that addresses all three questions, incorporating relevant information from the documents. The context should:

1. Include key details needed to answer each question
2. Present information in a clear, logical flow
3. Avoid directly quoting or referencing the source documents
4. Be written in natural, engaging language
5. Provide enough detail to support answering questions of varying complexity

Your response should be a cohesive passage that enables answering all three questions while maintaining readability and flow.
