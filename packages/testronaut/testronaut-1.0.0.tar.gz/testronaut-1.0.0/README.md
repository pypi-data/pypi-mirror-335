# Testronaut

**A CLI tool that bridges code analytics, automated test generation, and smart CI/CD optimization—so your dev workflow scales with your codebase.**

---

## 💡 Inspiration

As developers, we’re responsible for writing efficient, high-quality code — but that also means spending countless hours manually writing unit/integration tests and analyzing code performance. These tasks can take up **over 20% of a developer's day** in the industry.

**Testronaut** streamlines this process by automating the first step in the CI/CD pipeline, all from within your terminal — no need to leave your IDE.

## 🔧 What It Does

Testronaut is a terminal-based CLI tool powered by Google Gemini, built to accelerate various parts of the software development lifecycle:

- ✅ **Test Case Generation**  
  Automatically generate unit tests and integration tests from source code.

- 🚀 **Code Performance Analysis**  
  Analyze performance bottlenecks and get suggestions for optimization.

- 🧼 **Code Refactoring**  
  Get clean, efficient refactoring suggestions to improve maintainability and readability.

- 🔁 **CI/CD Pipeline Checks**  
  Quickly validate your CI/CD configuration files for common issues and misconfigurations.

## 🛠️ How We Built It

Testronaut combines the power of **Python**, **Node.js**, and **Google Gemini** to deliver a smooth developer experience:

- **Python** – Core CLI logic and orchestration
- **Node.js** – Enhances the terminal interface for better visuals
- **Google Gemini API** – Leverages LLMs for code analysis and generation
- **PyPI** – Easy installation and distribution

We designed the tool with a **modular architecture**, separating functionalities into test generation, performance analysis, refactoring, and CI/CD validation for future scalability.

## 🏆 Accomplishments

- A clean and functional CLI experience
- Seamless integration with Google Gemini for LLM-powered suggestions
- A fully modular design — easy to extend and maintain
- Published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/testronaut) for quick installation via `pip`
- Automates multiple parts of the SDLC from a single terminal command

## 🚧 What’s Next

We plan to continue developing Testronaut by:

- Supporting more programming languages and CI/CD providers
- Fine-tuning LLM prompts for more accurate results
- Allowing developers to bring their own LLMs for increased control/security
- Adding a plugin system to support community-built modules
- Exploring IDE plugin integrations (VSCode, JetBrains, etc.)
- Adding deeper CI/CD inspection including security and performance validations
