# Awk Exercises

This TUI application includes 80+ questions meant to be solved using `GNU awk`. Some exercises will require you to combine `awk` with other CLI tools such as `tac`.

> **Note:** This application is intended to be run in a Linux-like environment. You might still be able to solve the exercises on other platforms, but I do not know if that'll work.
