# Anagram Package
A package that contains a collection of playful word based functions, allowing you generate and check anagrams, as well as solve missing letter puzzles and find palindromes!

## Installation

Install this package using pip: \
`pip install anagram-package`

## Functions
This Program currently contains four functions:
1. fill_word(pattern): This takes a String containing one word with any number of letters replaced with an underscore '_', and returns all words that could fill the gap. eg. "Pyt_on" would return "Python".
    - Parameters:
        - `pattern`: Required. A String containing only one word (no spaces), with any amount of letters replaced with an underscore ('_'). 
    - Return: Returns a list of strings, respresenting all words that could fill the missing spaces in the word given in `pattern`.
2. create_anagram(word): This takes a String containing one word, and returns a list of strings containing every anagram of that word.
   - Parameters:
        - `word`: Required. A String containing only one word (no spaces).
    - Return: Returns a list of strings, respresenting anagrams of the word entered in `word`.
3. check_anagram(word1,word2): This takes two strings, each containing one word (no spaces), and checks if they are anagrams of each other. It will return a boolean of the result of the comparision.
    - Parameters:
        - `word1`: Required. A String containing only one word (no spaces).
        - `word2`: Required. A String containing only one word (no spaces).
    - Return: Returns a boolean, which is true if `word1` and `word2` are anagrams, and false if not.
4. filter_palindromes(words): Takes a list of Strings each containing only one word (no spaces), and returns a list of the words that are palindromes.
   - Parameters:
        - `words`: Required. A List of Strings each containing only one word (no spaces).
   - Return: Retursn a list of Strings containing all the Strings from `words` that are palindromic.
