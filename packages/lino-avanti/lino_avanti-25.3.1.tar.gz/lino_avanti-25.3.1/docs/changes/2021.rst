:ticket:`3950`: The :meth:`__str__` method of
:class:`lino_avanti.lib.avant.Client` now also shows the primary coach
(:attr:`Client.user <lino_avanti.lib.avant.Client.user>`) between the
parentheses. EnrolmentsByCourse no longer shows the :attr:`request_date
<lino_xl.lib.courses.Enrolment.request_date>` column.
