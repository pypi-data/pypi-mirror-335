config:
  short_help: "Update configuration settings."
  detailed_help: |
    Update configuration settings.

    This command supports two modes for modifying configuration:

    1. Field Update Mode:
       Use dot notation to update configuration fields directly.

       For example:
       remoterl config --batch_size 64 --lr_init 0.0005 --env CartPole-v1
       remoterl config --max_run 360

       This mode updates any key in the top-level configuration (such as: rllib, sagemaker)
       without requiring dedicated subcommands.

    2. Method Mode:
       Use dedicated methods to add or remove configuration entries in specific sections.
       The following functions are available, using the syntax:
       remoterl config exploration set/del [identifier] [--option value ...]

       a. Exploration Configuration:
          - Set:
            remoterl config exploration set continuous --type gaussian_noise --param1 0.1 --param2 0.001
          - Delete:
            remoterl config exploration del continuous

    Choose Field Update Mode for simple, direct key modifications and Method Mode for more guided, complex configuration changes.

edit:
  short_help: "Open the configuration file in the system's default text editor for manual modification."
  detailed_help: |

    only that part of the configuration is displayed.

simulate:
  short_help: "Start an environment simulation via the RemoteRL WebSocket server for cloud training."
  detailed_help: |
    Launch an environment simulation.

    Porcess:    
     1. Launch Simulation Server Automatically:
        - RemoteRL CLI Starts a simulation server on user side and trainer on cloud side watining for sagemaker training job to start.

     2. Monitor & Terminate:
        - The simulation runs in the current terminal.
        - Press Ctrl+C to gracefully terminate the simulation.

    Examples:
     remoterl simulate

train:
  short_help: "Launch a SageMaker training job for RemoteRL with configuration settings."
  detailed_help: |
