# mathxyz

**mathxyz** is a state-of-the-art math solver library that leverages advanced symbolic, numerical to solve a wide range of mathematical problems with high accuracy and efficiency. Whether you need to multiply massive integers, compute derivatives and integrals, solve differential equations, or perform optimization, mathxyz provides a robust, high-performance solution.

---

## Features

- **High-Precision Integer Multiplication:**  
  Multiply very large integers exactly using FFT-based convolution.

- **Efficient Exponentiation:**  
  Compute powers using fast exponentiation with memoization and display results in both exact and scientific notation.

- **High-Precision Division:**  
  Perform division using the Newton-Raphson method to compute reciprocals with adjustable precision.

- **Advanced Symbolic and Numerical Solving:**  
  Solve algebraic equations, transcendental equations, and even complex differential equations using the powerful capabilities of [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/).

- **AI-Inspired Problem Parsing:**  
  Uses regex-based pattern recognition to intelligently detect and parse derivatives, integrals, differential equations, and optimization problems from plain text input.

## Installation

You can install mathxyz via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):

```bash
pip install mathxyz
```

Or clone the repository and install manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mr-r0ot/mathxyz.git
cd mathxyz
pip install .
```

## Usage

Below are some examples to get you started:

### Solve an Algebraic Equation

```python
import mathxyz

result = mathxyz.math_solver("2*x + 3 = 7")
print(result)  
# Output: Symbolic solution: {x: 2}
```

### Compute a Derivative

```python
import mathxyz

result = mathxyz.math_solver("derivative(sin(x), x)")
print(result)
# Output: Derivative of sin(x) with respect to x:
#         cos(x)
```

### Compute an Integral

```python
import mathxyz

result = mathxyz.math_solver("integral(x**2, x)")
print(result)
# Output: Integral of x**2 with respect to x:
#         x**3/3 + C
```

### Solve a Differential Equation

```python
import mathxyz

result = mathxyz.math_solver("dsolve(Derivative(y(x), x) - y(x), y(x))")
print(result)
# Output: Differential equation solution: y(x) = C1*exp(x)
```

### Optimization Example

```python
import mathxyz

result = mathxyz.math_solver("maximize(x**2 - 4*x + 4)")
print(result)
# Output: Maximize of x**2 - 4*x + 4 at x = ... with value ...
```

### High-Precision Multiplication

```python
import mathxyz

result = mathxyz.multiply(12345678901234567890, 987654321)
print(result)
# Output: 121932631137021795223746380111126352690
```
