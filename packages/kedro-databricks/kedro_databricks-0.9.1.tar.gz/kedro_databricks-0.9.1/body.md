## 0.9.1 (2025-03-22)

### Fix

- implement example for all fields in databricks jobs api 2.2
- access_control_list has multiple lookup keys
- add ability to ignore keyed overrides for specific fields
- there is no element called on_duration_failure_threshold_exceeded
- if element is not a dict override the whole list
