    "description":"Natural gas is fed into the autothermal reformer (ATR) plant via pipeline at 435 psia, desulfurized, and mixed with steam at 400°C. At these conditions, ethane and heavier species are cracked in a prereformer to avoid subsequent coking in the autothermal reformer reactor. Cryogenic air separation unit provides 95% oxygen feed at 480 psia to the prereformer outlet stream. The autothermal reformer is fed with an overall oxygen to carbon (O₂/C) ratio of 0.65 and a steam to carbon (H₂O/C) ratio of 1.5. Autothermal reforming reactor has two operating sections – a partial oxidation portion, which is exothermic and a subsequent steam reforming portion which is endothermic. The reactor is catalyzed and gas outlet temperature of 1,093°C provides a carbon conversion rate of over 99%. ATR syngas is then cooled to 204°C and fed to a shift reactor, converting 97% of syngas carbon monoxide to hydrogen. Shift exhaust is augmented with recirculated pressure swing absorber (PSA) effluent to increase concentration of CO₂ before a methyl diethanolamine scrubber. 94.5% of product CO₂ is captured, dried, and compressed for transport and sequestration. Scrubber effluent is then fed to a PSA unit at 340 psia and product hydrogen with 99.9% purity and 330 psia is made available for subsequent compression and transmission. Non-hydrogen species are desorbed from the PSA unit at 20 psia. 31% of the effluent gas is then recycled to the shift exhaust and the remaining combustibles are burned with supplemental air before venting to the atmosphere.",
