    "description":"The systems examined are based on the Battelle/FERCO indirectly-heated biomass gasifier, conventional catalytic steam reforming, water gas shift, and pressure swing adsorption purification.  The indirectly-heated biomass gasifier uses hot sand, circulating between the char combustor and the gasifier, to provide the heat necessary for gasification.  Steam is used as the fluidizing gas; no oxygen (as pure oxygen or air) is fed to the gasifier.  The biomass feedstock is assumed to be a woody biomass, represented as hybrid poplar.",
