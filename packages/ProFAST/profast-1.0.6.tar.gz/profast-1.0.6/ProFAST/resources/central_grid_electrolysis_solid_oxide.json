    "description":"The modeled system is a standalone grid powered solid oxide electrolyzer (SOEC) with a total hydrogen production capacity of 50,000 kg/day. The process is based on a generic system using input from several key industry collaborators with commercial experience in SOEC system and subsystem technoeconomic modelling. Users can model nuclear-SOEC by changing the electricity price (cell G25) to a cost of nuclear-derived electricity and also modify the cost of thermal heat (cell G29) to that of heat derived from a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor*. * SOECs split water into hydrogen at elevated temperature, which weakens the bonds between hydrogen and oxygen and results in lower electricity requirements for water splitting. In order to achieve high temperatures, heat can be supplied through various means â€“ e.g. burning of natural gas, resistive electric heating, or through the use of high quality nuclear reactor derived heat.",
