    "description": "The modeled system is a standalone grid powered PEM electrolyzer system with a total hydrogen production capacity of 50,000 kg/day. The production system is based on a generic system using input from several key industry collaborators (KIC) with commercial experience in PEM electrolysis and brief system and subsystem technoeconomic models, the electrolyzer units use process water, passed through deionizing beds, and grid electricity for electrolysis",
