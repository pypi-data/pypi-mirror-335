    "description":"Natural gas is fed into the steam methane reformer (SMR) plant via a pipeline at 450 psia. The gas is desulfurized, and mixed with steam at 395°C. The reformer reactor is fed with an overall steam to carbon (H₂O/C) ratio of 2.56. The endothermic steam methane reforming reaction is performed on the cold side of a tube-shell heat exchanger and heat is supplied on the hot side of the heat exchanger by combustion of pressure swing adsorber (PSA) effluent and supplemental natural gas. Product syngas exits the reactor at 870°C and is cooled to 204°C before entering a shift reactor. In the shift reactor, carbon monoxide from the syngas reacts with steam to produce more hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Product hydrogen rich product is further purified through a PSA system resulting in pure hydrogen at 346 psia.",
