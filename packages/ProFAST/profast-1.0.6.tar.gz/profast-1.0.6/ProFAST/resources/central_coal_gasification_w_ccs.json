    "description":"There are two Shell dry feed, pressurized, up-flow, entrained, slagging gasifiers, operating at 4.2 MPa (615 psia).  The air separation plant supplies 95 percent O₂ to the gasifiers. Coal reacts with O₂ and steam at a temperature of 1,427°C (2,600°F) in the gasifier to produce principally H₂ and CO with little CO₂ formed.  The gasifier’s refractory-lined water wall is protected by molten slag that solidifies on the cooled walls. Syngas exiting the gasifier is converted to a CO₂ and H₂-rich syngas to maximize H₂ product yield and maximize the extent of CO₂ separation that can be performed on the high-pressure syngas stream.  CO is converted to CO₂ by reacting with steam over a bed of water gas shift catalyst. CO₂ and H₂S are removed via acid gas removal (AGR), which is a two-stage Selexol process. Hydrogen is further purified using a PSA system. CO₂ is transported via 100 mile pipeline and injected into a geologic saline storage site.",
