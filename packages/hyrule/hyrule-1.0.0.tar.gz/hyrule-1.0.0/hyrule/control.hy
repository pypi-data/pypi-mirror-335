(defmacro branch [tester #* rest]
  #[[Evaluate a test form with the symbol ``it`` bound to each of several case
  forms in turn. If the result is true, the result form associated with the
  matching case is evaluated and returned; no later cases are evaluated. If no
  case matches, return ``None``. The general syntax is::

      (branch TEST
        CASE-1 RESULT-1
        CASE-2 RESULT-2
        …)

  For example,
  ::

      (branch (in (.lower my-char) it)
        "aeiou" "it's a vowel"
        "xyz"   "it's one of those last few")

  is equivalent to
  ::

      (cond
        (in (.lower my-char) "aeiou") "it's a vowel"
        (in (.lower my-char) "xyz")   "it's one of those last few")

  If you miss Common Lisp's ``typecase`` macro, here's how you can use
  ``branch`` to branch by type in the same way::

     (branch (isinstance my-value it)
       str           "It's a string"
       bytes         "It's a bytes object"
       #(int float) "It's numeric")

  A case form that is exactly the symbol ``else`` is treated specially. In this
  case, the test form isn't evaluated, and is treated as if it returned true.
  ::

      (branch (= it my-value)
        True  "Correct"
        False "Wrong"
        else  "Not actually Boolean")

  ``branch`` won't complain if you add more cases after the ``else`` case, even
  additional ``else`` cases, but they'll all be unreachable.

  If there are no case forms, the test form won't be evaluated, so the whole
  ``branch`` is a no-op.

  :hy:func:`ebranch` is a convenience macro for when you want the no-match case
  to raise an error. :hy:func:`case` and :hy:func:`ecase` are convenience
  macros for the special case of checking equality against a single test
  value.]]

(defmacro case [key #* rest]
  #[[Like the Common Lisp macro of the same name. Evaluate the first argument,
  called the key, and compare it with ``=`` to each of several case forms in
  turn. If the key is equal to a case, the associated result form is evaluated
  and returned; no later cases are evaluated. If no case matches, return
  ``None``. The general syntax is::

      (case KEY
        CASE-1 RESULT-1
        CASE-2 RESULT-2
        …)

  For example, you could translate direction names to vectors like this::

      (case direction
        "north" [ 0  1]
        "south" [ 0 -1]
        "east"  [ 1  0]
        "west"  [-1  0])

  Thus, ``(case KEY …)`` is equivalent to ``(branch (= it KEY) …)``, except
  ``KEY`` is evaluated exactly once, regardless of the number of cases.

  Like :hy:func:`branch`, ``case`` treats the symbol ``else`` as a default
  case, and it has an error-raising version, :hy:func:`ecase`.

  ``case`` can't check for collection membership like the Common Lisp version;
  for that, use ``(branch (in KEY it) …)``. It also can't pattern-match; for
  that, see :hy:func:`match`.]]

  "Construct and immediately call an anonymous function with explicit `tail-call elimination <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail-call_elimination>`__. To see how it's used, consider this tail-recursive implementation of the factorial function::

    (defn factorial [n [acc 1]]
      (if n
        (factorial (- n 1) (* acc n))
        acc))

  With ``loop``, this would be written as::

    (require hyrule [loop])
    (import hyrule [recur])

    (defn factorial [n]
      (loop [[n n] [acc 1]]
        (if n
          (recur (- n 1) (* acc n))
          acc)))

  The :hy:class:`recur` object holds the arguments for the next call. When the function returns a :hy:class:`recur`, ``loop`` calls it again with the new arguments. Otherwise, ``loop`` ends and the final value is returned. Thus, what would be a nested set of recursive calls becomes a series of calls that are resolved entirely in sequence.

  Note that while ``loop`` uses the same syntax as ordinary function definitions for its lambda list, all parameters other than ``#* args`` and ``#** kwargs`` must have a default value, because the function will first be called with no arguments."

(defmacro block [#* body]
  #[[A macro that allows you to jump outside of a list of forms, like
  the Common Lisp special operator of the same name. The body forms
  are executed until ``(block-ret VALUE)`` is reached. The block
  returns ``VALUE``, or the value of the last form, if execution
  reached the end instead of being terminated by ``block-ret``.
  ``VALUE`` is optional and defaults to ``None``.

  One use of ``block`` is to jump out of nested loops::

      (block (for [x (range 5)]
        (setv y x)
        (while y
          (print x y)
          (when (and (= x 3) (= y 1))
            (block-ret))
          (-= y 1))))

  Blocks can be named by using a literal keyword or ``None`` as the
  first body form. Then you can use ``(block-ret-from NAME VALUE)`` to
  specify which block to jump out of in a nested sequence of blocks::

     (setv x "")
     (block :a
       (block :b
         (block :c
           (+= x "p")
           (block-ret-from :b)
           (+= x "q"))
         (+= x "r"))
       (+= x "s"))
     (print x)   ; => "ps"

  An anonymous block is treated as being named ``None``, and
  ``(block-ret)`` is actually short for ``(block-ret-from None)``.

  Block names are matched lexically at the time ``block`` is
  macro-expanded. ``(block-ret-from :foo)`` outside of a block named
  ``:foo`` is an error. Inner blocks names shadow outer blocks of the
  same name, so ``block-ret`` will apply to the innermost of a series
  of nested anonymous blocks.

  There are no macros or functions named ``block-ret`` or
  ``block-ret-from``, since these forms are processed entirely by
  ``block``. ``block-ret`` and ``block-ret-from`` should not be
  confused with Hy's built-in :hy:func:`return`, which produces a true Python
  return statement. ``block`` is implemented with exception-handling
  rather than functions, so it doesn't create a new scope as :hy:func:`fn`
