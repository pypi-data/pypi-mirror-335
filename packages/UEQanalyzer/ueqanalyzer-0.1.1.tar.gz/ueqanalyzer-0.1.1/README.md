**UEQanalyzer** is a Python package for analyzing and visualizing data from the **User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ)**. The UEQ is a fast and reliable questionnaire designed to measure the user experience of interactive products. It covers a comprehensive impression of user experience, including both classical usability aspects (efficiency, perspicuity, dependability) and user experience aspects (originality, stimulation).

This package provides tools to:
- Load and preprocess UEQ data.
- Calculate mean scores for UEQ dimensions.
- Transform and rescale data.
- Generate visualizations (e.g., dimension scores, item means, scale means with benchmarks).
- Handle edge cases (e.g., missing data, invalid files).

## Installation

You can install **UEQanalyzer** using `pip`:

```bash
pip install UEQanalyzer==0.1.0
```
Alternatively, you can install it directly from the source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pranj99/UEQAnalysis.git
cd UEQAnalysis
pip install .
```
## Usage
Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use UEQanalyzer to analyze and visualize UEQ data:
```bash
from UEQanalyzer.data_loader import load_ueq_data
from UEQanalyzer.analysis import calculate_mean_scores
from UEQanalyzer.visualization import plot_dimension_scores

# Load data
data = load_ueq_data("ueq_data.xlsx")

# Calculate mean scores
mean_scores = calculate_mean_scores(data)

# Plot dimension scores
plot_dimension_scores(mean_scores)
```
## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

You can also use the UEQanalyzer CLI to analyze and visualize UEQ data:

**Basic Usage**

To analyze UEQ data and display results in the terminal:
```bash
ueqanalyzer -i ueq_data.xlsx
```
**Save Results to a CSV File**

To save the analysis results to a CSV file:
```bash
ueqanalyzer -i ueq_data.xlsx -o results.csv
```
**Generate and Display Plots**

To generate and display plots for UEQ dimensions, item means, and scale means:
```bash
ueqanalyzer -i ueq_data.xlsx -p
```
**Save Results and Generate Plots**

To save the results to a CSV file and generate plots:
```bash
ueqanalyzer -i ueq_data.xlsx -o results.csv -p
```

- -i: Path to the input Excel file containing UEQ data.

- o: Path to save the analysis results (optional).

- p: Generate and display plots for UEQ dimensions.
