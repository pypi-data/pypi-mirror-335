Intel (R) Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel(R) IPP) provides developers with high-quality, production-ready, low-level building blocks for image processing, signal processing, and data processing (data compression and decompression) applications. This package provides C programming language interfaces. Intel IPP C language interfaces can be called from applications written in either C or C++, as well as in any other language that can reference a C interface. See also:
