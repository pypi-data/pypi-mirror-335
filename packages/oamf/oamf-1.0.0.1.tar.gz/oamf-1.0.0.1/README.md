AMF is a comprehensive toolkit designed to streamline and unify various argument mining modules into a single platform. By leveraging the Argument Interchange Format (AIF), AMF enables seamless communication between different components, including segmenters, turnators, argument relation identifiers, and argument scheme classifiers.

## üöÄ Features

- **Argument Segmentator**: Identifies and segments arguments within argumentative text.
- **Turninator**: Determines dialogue turns within conversations.
- **Argument Relation Identification**: Identifies argument relationships between argument units.
- **Argument Scheme Classification**: Classifies arguments based on predefined schemes.

## üìù Overview

AMF provides a modular approach to argument mining, integrating various components into a cohesive framework. The main features include:

- **Argument Segmentator:** Identifies and segments arguments within argumentative text.
- **Turninator:** Determines dialogue turns within conversations.
- **Argument Relation Identification:** Identifies argument relationships between argument units.
- **Argument Scheme Classification:** Classifies arguments based on predefined schemes.




## üõ† Installation
<details>
  <summary>Prerequisites & Setup</summary>

  <p>Ensure you have Python installed on your system. AMF is compatible with Python 3.6 and above.</p>

  <h3>Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment</h3>
  <p>It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:</p>
  <pre><code>python -m venv amf-env</code></pre>

  <p>Activate the virtual environment:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Windows:</strong>
      <pre><code>.\amf-env\Scripts\activate</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>macOS/Linux:</strong>
      <pre><code>source amf-env/bin/activate</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Step 2: Install Dependencies</h3>
  <p>With the virtual environment activated, install AMF using pip:</p>
  <pre><code>pip install argument-mining-framework</code></pre>
  <p>This command will install the latest version of AMF along with its dependencies.</p>

  <h3>Additional Setup Instructions</h3>
  <p>After installing the <code>argument-mining-framework</code> package, make sure to download the necessary NLTK data and spaCy models:</p>
  <pre><code>python -m nltk.downloader stopwords
python -m nltk.downloader wordnet
python -m nltk.downloader averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng
python -m nltk.downloader omw-1.4

python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm</code></pre>

## üß© Components

### Argument Segmentor

The Argument Segmentor component is responsible for detecting and segmenting arguments within text. 

[Read More](http://default-segmenter.amfws.arg.tech/segmenter-01)

### Turnator

The Turnator identifies and segments dialogue turns, facilitating the analysis of conversations and interactions within texts. This module is particularly useful for dialogue-based datasets.

[Read More](http://default-turninator.amfws.arg.tech/turninator-01)

### Argument Relation Identifier

This component identifies and categorizes the relationships between argument units.

[Read More](http://bert-te.amfws.arg.tech/bert-te)

### Argument Scheme Classifier

The Argument Scheme Classifier categorizes arguments based on predefined schemes, enabling structured argument analysis.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

### Predictor Example

Below is an example of how to use the AMF Predictor class to generate an argument map using an input provided based on AIF:

```python
from argument_mining_framework.argument_relation.predictor import ArgumentRelationPredictor
import json

# Initialize Predictor
predictor = ArgumentRelationPredictor(model_type="dialogpt", variant="vanilla")

# Example XAIF structure
xaif = {
    "AIF": {
        "nodes": [
            {"nodeID": "1", "text": "THANK YOU", "type": "I", "timestamp": "2016-10-31 17:17:34"},
            {"nodeID": "2", "text": "COOPER : THANK YOU", "type": "L", "timestamp": "2016-11-10 18:34:23"},
            # Add more nodes as needed
        ],
        "edges": [
            {"edgeID": "1", "fromID": "1", "toID": "20", "formEdgeID": "None"},
            {"edgeID": "2", "fromID": "20", "toID": "3", "formEdgeID": "None"}
            # Add more edges as needed
        ],
        "locutions": [],
        "participants": []
    },
    "text": "people feel that they have been treated disrespectfully..."
}

# Convert XAIF structure to JSON string
xaif_json = json.dumps(xaif)

# Predict argument relations
result_map = predictor.argument_map(xaif_json)
print(result_map)
```


### Full Workflow Example

In this section, we demonstrate how to use multiple components of the AMF framework in a complete argument mining workflow. This example shows how to process a text input through the Turninator, Segmenter, Propositionalizer, and Argument Relation Predictor components and visualize the output.

```python
import logging
from argument_mining_framework.loader import Module

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def process_pipeline(input_data: str) -> None:
    """Process input data through the entire argument mining pipeline."""

    # Initialize components
    modules = {
        'turninator': Module('turninator'),
        'segmenter': Module('segmenter'),
        'propositionalizer': Module('propositionalizer'),
        'argument_relation': Module('argument_relation', "DAM", "01"),
        'hypothesis': Module('hypothesis', "roberta", "vanilla"),
        'scheme': Module('scheme', "roberta", "vanilla"), 
        'visualiser': Module('visualiser')
    }

    # Step 1: Turninator
    turninator_output = modules['turninator'].get_turns(input_data, True)
    logging.info('Turninator output: %s', turninator_output)

    # Step 2: Segmenter
    segmenter_output = modules['segmenter'].get_segments(turninator_output)
    logging.info('Segmenter output: %s', segmenter_output)

    # Step 3: Propositionalizer
    propositionalizer_output = modules['propositionalizer'].get_propositions(segmenter_output)
    logging.info('Propositionalizer output: %s', propositionalizer_output)

    # Step 4: Argument Relation Prediction
    argument_map_output = modules['argument_relation'].get_argument_map(propositionalizer_output)
    logging.info('Argument relation prediction output: %s', argument_map_output)

    # Additional Analysis
    claims = modules['argument_relation'].get_all_claims(argument_map_output)
    logging.info("Extracted claims: %s", claims)

    evidence = modules['argument_relation'].get_evidence_for_claim(
        "But this isn‚Äôt the time for vaccine nationalism", argument_map_output)
    logging.info("Evidence for claim: %s", evidence)

    # Hypothesis Prediction
    hypothesis_results = modules['hypothesis'].predict([
        "But this isn‚Äôt the time for vaccine nationalism",
        "Vaccine is useful to prevent infections."
    ])
    logging.info("Hypothesis prediction: %s", hypothesis_results)

    # Scheme Prediction
    scheme_results = modules['scheme'].predict([
        "But this isn‚Äôt the time for vaccine nationalism",
        "Vaccine is useful to prevent infections."
    ])
    logging.info("Scheme prediction: %s", scheme_results)

    # Visualize the argument map
    modules['visualiser'].visualise(argument_map_output)
