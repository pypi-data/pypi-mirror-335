     * Specify the region of the imaging sensor used for range measurement.
     * 
     * <p>The region of interest refers to the pixels within the time of flight imaging sensor
     * that are used to detect reflected laser light form the target.  The sensor contains
     * a 16x16 pixel grid.   By default, all 256 pixels are used which results in a roughly
     * 27 degree field of view.
     * 
     * <p>The Field of view refers to a cone which grows from the time of flight sensor outward.
     * By reducing the size of the region of interest (by using a smaller area of pixels) it is
     * possible to reduce the field of view.  This can be helpfull when measuring objects far
     * away.  The smaller the field of view, the smaller the area where the sensor can detect 
     * targets.
     * 
     * <p>Reducing the region of interest will reduce the sensitivity of the sensor.  It may be 
     * necessary to increase the reflectivity of the target or to increase the sample time to 
     * compensate.
     * 
     * <p>The range of interest rows and columns must be greater or equal to zero and less than
     * or equal to fifteen.   The top left corner row/column must be smaller than the bottom
     * right column/row.  The region of interest must be at least four coulmns wide and four
     * rows tall.   For example, to specify a 4x4 region at the center of the image sensor use:
     * 
     * <p>TimeOfFlight_SetRangeOfInterest(pHandle, 8, 8, 12, 12);
