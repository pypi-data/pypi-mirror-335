        *Instructions for Labeling Drug References in Social Media Posts*

        1. **Objective**: Identify references to drugs or people who use drugs in each post.

        2. **Include**:
        - Illicit Drugs: All controlled substances with no legal usage (e.g. cannabis, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine)
        - Prescription Drugs: drugs that are often abused even if they have legitimate medical uses (e.g., opioids, benzodiazepines).
        - Other Drugs: drugs that are non-prescription and known to be abused (e.g., inhalants, k2, bath salts).
        - Explicit mentions of drug use, abuse, or addiction related terms (e.g., "getting high", "stoned").

        3. **Exclude**:
        - Tobacco, nicotine, or alcohol unless explicitly linked to drug use.
        - Do not include medical or psychological discussions unless there is a direct and clear mention of drug use or abuse.

        4. **Clarifications**:
        - Mental health discussions should not be labeled as 'D' unless there is an explicit mention of drugs as defined above.
        - Use 'ND' for posts that discuss health or psychological issues without specific drug references.

        5. **Language Cues**:
        - Focus on clear drug-related terminology (e.g., "junkie", "addict") and slang.
        - If a post is ambiguous and does not clearly fit the drug reference criteria, label as 'ND'.

        6. **Response Requirement**:
        - Respond with either 'D' (Drug) or 'ND' (Non-Drug) based on these guidelines. No additional commentary is needed.

        **Instructions:**
        You are an expert in identifying stigma related to drug use and addiction in social media posts. Your task is to analyze each post and determine if it contains stigmatizing language. 

        1. **Label:**
            * If the post contains stigmatizing language, label it as **"S" (Stigma)**.
            * If the post does not contain stigmatizing language, label it as **"NS" (Non-Stigma)**.

        2. **Explanation:**
            * **For "S" (Stigma) labels:**
                * If the post demonstrates **stigmatizing language (directed at others)**, analyze it based on the following four attributes and provide an explanation for each attribute:
                    * **Labeling:** Does the post use derogatory or othering language related to drug use/addiction?
                    * **Stereotyping:** Does the post reinforce negative generalizations about people who use drugs?
                    * **Separation:** Does the post create a divide between people who use drugs and those who don't?
                    * **Discrimination:** Does the post imply or suggest unfair treatment based on drug use?
                * If the post demonstrates **self-stigma or structural stigma**, provide a brief, one-sentence explanation of the type of stigma present.

            * **For "NS" (Non-Stigma) labels:** No explanation is needed.

        **Definitions:**

        * **Stigma:** Negative attitudes or beliefs directed at individuals based on their drug use.
        * **Self-Stigma:** Internalization of negative societal attitudes about drug use.
        * **Structural Stigma:** Societal systems, policies, or practices that disadvantage people who use drugs.

        **Additional Considerations:**

        * Consider the context of the post and the author's intent.
        * Focus on language that is harmful, discriminatory, or perpetuates negative stereotypes.

        **Task:**
        Read the following post, label it as "S" or "NS", and provide the appropriate explanation:
