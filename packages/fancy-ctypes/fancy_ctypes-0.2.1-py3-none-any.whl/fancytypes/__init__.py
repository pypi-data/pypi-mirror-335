FancyTypes - Shared libraries in a fancy way
============================================

The `fancytypes <https://github.com/hlatorrec/fancy-ctypes>`_ package is a 
`ctypes <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html>`_ wrapper. It provides 
**syntax sugar that makes it easier to include C and Fortran code in your 
Python projects** through the use of shared libraries.

.. admonition:: What is a shared library
    :class: hint
    
    Shared libraries, also called binaries, are **executable code that can be 
    used by another program**. The `Wikipedia 
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_library>`_ article covers them in 
    more detail.

FancyTypes makes your interfaces to shared libraries simpler and clearer. 
**Calling functions becomes very straightforward and working with arrays is now 
very easy**.

This package assumes that **the user already knows some Python and has some 
basic programming experience in lower level languages** so that they can more 
easily dive into the world of language interoperability. This is likely the 
case for anyone who has already compiled and run some small program written in 
C or even Fortran (2003+ standard, not 77 or any similar abominations, though 
the later can be salvaged, sometimes).

.. note::

    Users who already have some experience with language interoperability may 
    skip directly to the documentation section, which describes the API.
