# cli-bob

cli-bob uses AI to generate command line code in case you can't remember the exact syntax.

![](docs/screenshot1.png)

Under the hood, it uses the [claude](https://anthropic.com/api/) API to generate commands.

## Installation

```bash
pip install cli-bob
```

You also need to set an environment variable named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as `cli-bob` uses the claude LLM for generating commands.

## Usage

On the termal start typing `bob` and afterwards specify what you want to do. 
`cli-bob` will then generate a command proposal for you and you can hit ENTER to run it.
You can also modify the command before running it.
Hit ESC to cancel execution.
