Naming consistency in your code is important for maintainability and readability. Python developers typically follow the PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code for naming conventions, which include:

CamelCase for class names: class MyClassName:
snake_case for function and variable names: def my_function: or my_variable = 10
CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE for constants: CONSTANT_VALUE = 42
_leading_underscore for "private" or "protected" identifiers: class _Base:
__double_leading_underscore for name mangling (useful in inheritance to avoid naming conflicts): class MyClass: def __method:
__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__ for special Python methods and attributes (like __init__ or __str__).
Additionally, it's important to use descriptive names for clarity:

Avoid using single-character variables (except for very short blocks, like list comprehensions or loops).
Function names should be verbs if they perform actions, and nouns if they return data.
Avoid generic names like obj, data, etc., unless in very generic contexts.
Be consistent with your names; for example, if you have get_user_info and get_account_details, avoid naming another function fetch_data_records.

Here are a few more specific tips:
Avoid abbreviations that are unclear: calculate_statistics is better than calc_stats.
Use terms from the problem domain: If your code is about chemistry, molecule_weight is better than mw.
If your project or organization has specific conventions, always adhere to those.
