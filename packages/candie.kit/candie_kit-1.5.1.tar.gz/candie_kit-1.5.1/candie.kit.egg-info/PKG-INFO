## Installation

Candie.kit is is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/candie.kit) so it can be installed with this command.
```sh
pip install candie.kit
```

### candie CLI

After installation you can run this command to get help.
or verify that its successfully installed.
```
candie --help
```

## Getting started

Every project must contain a Build Instruction file, Named `Candiefile` and this file should always be placed in the project root directory.

project/<br>
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.c<br>
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ greet.c<br>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Candiefile

So create this file for your project.
The `Candiefile` file can contain sections of code. 

A Section can be created like this [SECTION_NAME] 
using square brackets,
section name must be UPPERCASE.
[SETUP] is a required section.

Example __Candiefile__ üëáÔ∏è
```py
[SETUP]

PROJ_NAME = 'your_project_name'

project(
    name = PROJ_NAME, 
    language = C, 
)


[BUILD]

executable(
    PROJ_NAME,
    './main.c',
    './greet.c'
).create()

```

You can either provide the source file paths manually or use the `grab_sources()` function
and provide the directory path of the src files.

Call the `create()` method to create the executable, You can provide `.create(debug = True)` to add debugging symbols to the executable.

finally, run this command to execute the build section.
```sh
candie build
```
This will create a executable named `'your_project_name'`<br>
Here, Example project [simple-exe](./examples/simple-exe/)
