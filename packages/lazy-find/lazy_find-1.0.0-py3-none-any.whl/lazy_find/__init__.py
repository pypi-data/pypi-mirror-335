#
# This code is adapted from importlib.util. Doing so allows a few invasive
# changes to the LazyLoader chain:
#
#    1. Replace `threading` import with `_thread` to match which module
#       importlib._bootstrap uses internally, and do it at the top level to
#       avoid circular import issues.
#        a. There's a chance this causes issues when this module is used in
#           emscripten or wasi, but that needs testing.
#    2. Special-case `__spec__` in the lazy module type to avoid loading
#       being unnecessarily triggered by internal importlib machinery.
#    3. Avoid importing `types`.
#    4. Slightly adjust method signatures to be more in line with object's.
