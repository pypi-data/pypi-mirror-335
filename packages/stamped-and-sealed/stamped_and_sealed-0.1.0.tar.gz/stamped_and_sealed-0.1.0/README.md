# Python Package Exercise

An exercise to create a Python package, build it, test it, distribute it, and use it. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

## Features
*CodeJester* is a Python package designed to make coding more fun with simple text transformations and feel-good messages. It includes four features: reversing text, converting words into leetspeak, generating random compliments for developers, and generating random fortunes for developers. 

The **Reverse Text** function flips any string backward, giving a fun twist to your input. The **Leetspeak** converter transforms text into a stylized hacker-style format (e.g., "hello" becomes "h3ll0"). The **Developer Compliments** feature provides developers with encouraging messages like "Your code is a masterpiece in the making" or "You're a debugging pro," based on the type of compliment you choose (debugging, coding, or motivational). Inspired by fortune cookies, the **Fortune** function provides developers with fortunes like "Your potential is limited only by your imagination" or "First, solve the problem. Then, write the code," based on a chosen theme (inspirational, funny, or programming).  

Now matter which feature you decide to use, *CodeJester* adds a bit of positivity and entertainment to a developer's workflow.

***
## How a developer who wants to import your project into their own code can do so - include documentation and code examples for all functions in your package and a link to an example Python program that uses each of them.

To use the functions from our package in your own code, you'll need to import them as follows:

```python
from stamped_and_sealed import dev_compliment, leetspeak, reverse_text, fortune_py
```

Function Documentation and Examples

### `dev_compliment(category: str) -> None`

Provides positive affirmations for developers in different categories.

**Parameters:**
- `category` (str): The category of compliment. Options include "debugging", "coding", or "motivation".

**Returns:**
- None (prints the compliment to the console)

**Example usage:**
```python
from stamped_and_sealed import dev_compliment

# Get a coding-related compliment
dev_compliment("coding")

# Get a debugging-related compliment
dev_compliment("debugging")

# Get a motivational compliment
dev_compliment("motivation")
```

### `leetspeak(text: str) -> str`

Converts normal text into leetspeak by replacing letters with numbers and symbols.

**Parameters:**
- `text` (str): The normal text to convert.

**Returns:**
- str: The text converted to leetspeak.

**Example usage:**
```python
from stamped_and_sealed import leetspeak

# Convert a simple message
normal_text = "Hello World"
leet_text = leetspeak(normal_text)
print(leet_text)  # Output: "#3||0 \\/\\/0|2|d"

# Use with user input
user_input = input("Enter text to convert: ")
converted = leetspeak(user_input)
print(f"Leetspeak version: {converted}")
```

### `reverse_text(text: str) -> str`

Reverses the characters in the provided text.

**Parameters:**
- `text` (str): The input string to reverse.

**Returns:**
- str: The reversed string.

**Example usage:**
```python
from stamped_and_sealed import reverse_text

# Reverse a simple message
original = "Python is fun"
reversed_message = reverse_text(original)
print(reversed_message)  # Output: "nuf si nohtyP"

# Create a palindrome checker
def is_palindrome(word):
    return word.lower() == reverse_text(word).lower()

print(is_palindrome("radar"))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("Python"))  # Output: False
```

### PyFortune Functions

#### `pyfortune.generate_fortune(theme: str = "inspirational") -> str`

Generates a fortune cookie message from the specified theme.

**Parameters:**
- `theme` (str, optional): The theme of fortune to generate. Options include "inspirational", "funny", or "programming". Default is "inspirational".

**Returns:**
- str: A fortune message from the selected theme.

**Example usage:**
```python
from stamped_and_sealed import fortune_py

# Get a default (inspirational) fortune
fortune = fortune_py.generate_fortune()
print(fortune)

# Get a funny fortune
funny_fortune = fortune_py.generate_fortune("funny")
print(funny_fortune)

# Get a programming-related fortune
prog_fortune = fortune_py.generate_fortune("programming")
print(prog_fortune)
```

#### `pyfortune.format_fortune(message: str, format_type: str = "plain") -> str`

Formats a message with the specified formatting style.

**Parameters:**
- `message` (str): The message to format.
- `format_type` (str, optional): The formatting style to apply. Options include "plain" or "ascii_box". Default is "plain".

**Returns:**
- str: The formatted message.

**Example usage:**
```python
from stamped_and_sealed import fortune_py

message = "Success is not final, failure is not fatal."

# Format with plain style (no special formatting)
plain = fortune_py.format_fortune(message, "plain")
print(plain)

# Format with ASCII box
boxed = fortune_py.format_fortune(message, "ascii_box")
print(boxed)
```

#### `pyfortune.get_random_fortune() -> str`

Generates a random fortune from any available theme.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Returns:**
- str: A random fortune message.

**Example usage:**
```python
from stamped_and_sealed import fortune_py

# Get a random fortune
fortune = fortune_py.get_random_fortune()
print(fortune)

# Get and format a random fortune
random_fortune = fortune_py.get_random_fortune()
formatted = fortune_py.format_fortune(random_fortune, "ascii_box")
print(formatted)
```

## How a developer who wants to contribute to CodeJester can set up the virtual environment, install dependencies, and build and test your package for themselves

1. Fork and Clone the Repository: Start by forking the repository on GitHub and cloning it locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/software-students-spring2025/3-python-package-stamped_and_sealed.git
cd 3-python-package-stamped_and_sealed
```
2. Set Up the Virtual Environment: Use pipenv to manage dependencies and virtual environments. Install pipenv (if you havenâ€™t already) and set up the environment
```
pip install pipenv
pipenv install --dev
pipenv shell
```
3. Install Dependencies: Ensure all required dependencies are installed with `pipenv install`
4. Build and Test the Package: Before making any changes, run tests to ensure the package is working correctly by running `pytest`
5. Create a New Feature Branch: Before making any changes, create a new branch with `git checkout -b feature-new-function`
6. Make Your Changes and Commit: Once you have implemented your changes, stage and commit them:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature"
```
7. Push Your Changes and Create a Pull Request: Push your changes to your forked repository with  `git push origin feature-new-function`
