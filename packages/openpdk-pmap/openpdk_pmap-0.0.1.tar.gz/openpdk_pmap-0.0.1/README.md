# pmap for OpenPDK LVS

LVS scripts KLayout in OpenPDKs like Skywater `sky130A` or IHP `sg13g2` observe the total memory usage using `pmap`, which exists on Linux, but not on macOS or Windows.

KLayout-PEX is a parasitic extraction tool for [KLayout](https://klayout.org), and uses this package as a dependency on these platforms.
Check out the [documentation website](https://martinjankoehler.github.io/klayout-pex-website) for more information.
