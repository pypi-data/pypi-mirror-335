# HBS - Harmonic Beltrami Signature

This is a Python library for computing Harmonic Beltrami Signature(HBS). It provides a set of tools for boundary conditions, mesh generation, conformal welding and other mathematical problems, particularly suited for numerical computations in complex analysis.

## Reference
This implementation is based on the paper:

**Harmonic Beltrami Signature: A Novel 2D Shape Representation for Object Classification**

DOI: [10.1137/22M1470852](https://doi.org/10.1137/22M1470852)

## Installation

Install directly from PyPI:
```bash
pip install hbs
```

Or install from source:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChanceAroundYou/hbs_python.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Example

Compute HBS from image

```python
from hbs.boundary import get_boundary
from hbs import get_hbs

img_path = 'img/example.jpg'
bound = get_boundary(img_path, bound_point_num)
hbs, he, cw, disk = get_hbs(bound, circle_point_num, density)
```

Reconstruct shape from HBS
```python
from hbs import reconstruct_from_hbs

## `disk` must be a DiskMesh corresponding to give `hbs`
bound, _, _, _ = reconstruct_from_hbs(hbs, disk)
```
