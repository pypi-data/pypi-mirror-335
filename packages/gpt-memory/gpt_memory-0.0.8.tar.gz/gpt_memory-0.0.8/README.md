# GPT Memory

GPT Memory is a package that stores historical memory of your ChatGPT conversations and uses these memories to improve subsequent interactions. The system automatically classifies the memories and generates abstracts to complement the GPT context limitations.

## Features

- **Historical Memory Storage**: Stores and manages historical chat data.
- **Automatic Classification**: Automatically classifies chat memories for better organization.
- **Abstract Generation**: Generates abstracts of past conversations to enhance GPT's context handling.

## Installation

To install GPT Memory, use pip:

```bash
pip install gpt_memory
```

## Usage

### Importing and Using the Memory Class

To start using GPT Memory, import the `Memory` class and process a user message:

```python
from gpt_memory import Memory

m = Memory()
status, response = m.process_message('user_message')
```

### Command Line Chat Interface

You can also run the command line chat interface to interact with GPT Memory:

```bash
python ui.py
```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `Memory` class:

```python
from gpt_memory import Memory

# Initialize the memory system
memory_system = Memory()

# Process a user message
status, response = memory_system.process_message('Hello, how are you?')

# Print the status and response
print(f"Status: {status}")
print(f"Response: {response}")
```
