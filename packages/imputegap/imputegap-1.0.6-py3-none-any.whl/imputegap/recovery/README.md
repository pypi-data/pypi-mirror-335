# Patterns

All missingness patterns developed in ImputeGAP are available in the `ts.patterns` module.

## Setup

> **Note:**
>
> - **M** = number of time series
> - **N** = length of time series
> - **R** = rate of missing values chosen by the user (%); default = 0.2
> - **S** = offset in the beginning of the series (%); default = 0.1
> - **W** = R * N
<br>
> -

### Missing Percentage

> **Note:**
>
> - `M ∈ [1%, max]; R ∈ [1%, max]`
> - The size of a single missing block varies between 1% and (100 - `S`)% of `N`.
> - The starting position is the same and begins at `S` and progresses until `W` is reached, affecting the first series from the top up to `M%` of the dataset.

<br>

### Disjoint

> **Note:**
>
> - `M ∈ [1, max]; R ∈ [1%, max]`
> - The size of a single missing block varies between 1% and (100 - `S`)% of `N`.
> - The starting position of the first missing block begins at `S`.
> - Each subsequent missing block starts immediately after the previous one ends, continuing this pattern until the limit of the dataset or `N` is reached.

<br>

### Overlap

> **Note:**
>
> - `M ∈ [1, max]; R ∈ [1%, max]`
> - The size of a single missing block varies between 1% and (100 - `S`)% of `N`.
> - The starting position of the first missing block begins at `S`.
> - Each subsequent missing block starts after the previous one ends, but with a shift back of `X%`, creating an overlap.
> - This pattern continues until the limit or `N` is reached.

<br>

### Percentage Shift

> **Note:**
>
> - `M ∈ [1%, max]; R ∈ [1%, max]`
> - The size of a single missing block varies between 1% and (100 - `S`)% of `N`.
> - The starting position is randomly shifted by adding a random value to `S`, then progresses until `W` is reached, affecting the first series from the top up to `M%` of the dataset.

## MULTI-BLOCK

### Missing Completely At Random

> **Note:**
>
> - `M ∈ [1%, max]; R ∈ [1%, max]`
> - Data blocks of the same size are removed from arbitrary series at a random position between `S` and `N`, until a total of `W` per series is missing.

<br>

### Block Distribution

> **Note:**
>
> - `M ∈ [1%, max]; R ∈ [1%, max]`
> - Data is removed following a distribution given by the user for every value of `N`, affecting the first series from the top up to `M%` of the dataset.
