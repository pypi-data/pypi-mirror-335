    The responder is an object capable of making automatic replies to messages based on some
    keyword condition and constraints.

    Parameters
    --------------
    condition: BaseLogic
        The match condition. The condition represents the
        match condition of message's text.
    action: BaseResponse
        Represents the action taken on both ``condition`` and ``constraints`` being fulfilled.
    constraints: list[ConstraintBase]
        In addition to ``condition``, constraints add additional checks that need to be fulfilled
        before performing an action.
        All of the constraints inside the ``constraints`` list need to be fulfilled.
