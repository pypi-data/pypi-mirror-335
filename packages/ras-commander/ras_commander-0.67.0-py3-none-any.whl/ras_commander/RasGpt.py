# to be implemented later

# This class will contain  methods to help LLM's extract useful information from HEC-RAS models in a structured format with token budget etc. 
# Templates will be used to help with this, based on the example projects (1D Steady, 1D Usteady, 1D Sediment Transport, 1D Water Quality, 2D Unsteady, 2D Steady, 2D Sediment Transport, 2D Water Quality, 2D Geospatial, 3D Unsteady, 3D Steady, 3D Sediment Transport, 3D Water Quality, 3D Geospatial).
# These will simply filter the data to only include the relevant information for the area of focus. 

#
# IDEAS
# 1. Package up a standard set of information for LLM analysis
#       - General project information
#       - Cross section information (for specific cross sections)
#       - Structure information (for specific structures)
#       - Include time series results and relevant HEC Guidance for LLM to reference

# 2. Use Library Assistant to call LLM
