"""
RasToGo module provides functions to interface HEC-RAS with go-consequences.
This module helps prepare and format RAS data for use with go-consequences.


-----

All of the methods in this class are static and are designed to be used without instantiation.

List of Functions in RasToGo:

TO BE IMPLEMENTED: 
- Adding stored maps in rasmaapper for a results file
- Editing the terrain name for stored maps, so that a reduced resolution terrain can be used for mapping
- Re-computing specific plans using the floodplain mapping option to generate stored maps
- Using the stored map output to call go-consequences and compute damages
- Comparisons of go-consequences outputs based on RAS plan number
    - include optional argument with polygons defining areas of interest
