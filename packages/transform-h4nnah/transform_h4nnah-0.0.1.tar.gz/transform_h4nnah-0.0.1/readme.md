# Coordinate transforming package

This package converts coordinates from WGS84 to L-Est97 and the other way around.


# To install:

pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/transform-h4nnah

Because transform_h4nnah also uses Transformer from pyProj, this should be installed aswell, just in case:
pip install pyproj
