        Input arguments for the NSGA2 algorithm.

        :param crossover_operator_options: The options of the Simulated Binary Crossover

        the variables of parent solutions.
        :param mutation_operator_options:  The options to Polynomial Mutation (PM)
        operator used to mutate the variables of an individual. This defaults to a
        distribution index or index parameter of `20` and variable
        probability equal `1` divided by the number of real variables in the problem
        (i.e., each variable will have the
        same probability of being mutated).
        :param resume_from_file: Instead of initialising the population with random
        variables, see the initial population with the variable values from a JSON files
        exported with this tool. This option lets you restart the evolution
        from a previous generation; you can use any history file (exported when the
        field `export_history`) or the file exported when the stopping condition was
        reached.
        :param parallel: Whether the objective and constraint evaluation should run
        using threads. Defaults to `true` to run the pywr models in parallel.
        :param export_history: The options to configure the individual's history export.
        When provided, the algorithm will save objectives, constraints and solutions to
        a file each time the generation increases by a given step.
        This is useful to track convergence and inspect an algorithm evolution.
        :param seed: The seed used in the random number generator (RNG). You can specify
        a seed in case you want to try to reproduce results. NSGA2 is a stochastic
        algorithm that relies on a RNG at different steps (when population is initially
        generated, during selection, crossover and mutation) and, as such, may lead to
        slightly different solutions. The seed is randomly picked if this is `None`.

        having a different gap by providing an instance of `TwoLayerPartitions`. Use the
        last approach if you are trying to solve a problem with many objectives (4 or
        more) and want to reduce the number of reference points to use. Using two layers
        allows (1) setting a smaller number of reference points, (2) controlling the
