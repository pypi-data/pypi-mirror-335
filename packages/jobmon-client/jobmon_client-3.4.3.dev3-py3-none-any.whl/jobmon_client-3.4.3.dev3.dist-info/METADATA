# JobMon Client

## Introduction

JobMon is a Python package developed by IHME's Scientific Computing team,
designed to simplify and standardize the process of job monitoring and
workflow management in computational projects.
It facilitates the tracking of job statuses, manages dependencies,
and streamlines the execution of complex workflows across various computing environments.

This package is imported into the customer's codebase and used to interact with the JobMon server.
