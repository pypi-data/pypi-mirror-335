class SharedMemoryArray:
    """Wraps a one-dimensional numpy array object and exposes methods for accessing the array data from multiple Python
    processes.

    This class enables sharing data between multiple Python processes in a way that compliments the functionality of
    the multiprocessing Queue class. Like Queue, this class provides the means for sharing data between multiple
    processes by implementing a shared memory buffer. Unlike Queue, which behaves like a buffered stream, the
    SharedMemoryArray class behaves like a numpy array. Unlike with Queue, the size and datatype of the array are fixed
    after initialization and cannot be changed. However, the elements of the array can be randomly accessed and
    modified, unlike the elements of the Queue, that can only be processed serially.

    This class should only be instantiated inside the main process via its create_array() method. Do not attempt to
    instantiate the class manually. All child processes working with this class should use the connect() method to
    connect to the shared array wrapped by the class before calling any other method.

    Notes:
        Shared memory objects are garbage-collected differently depending on the host OS. On Windows, garbage collection
        is handed off to the OS and cannot be enforced manually. On Unix (OSx and Linux), the buffer can be
        garbage-collected via appropriate commands. Make sure you call the destroy() method as part of your cleanup
        routine for each process that creates the SharedMemoryArray instance on Unix platforms, or your system will be
        hogged by leftover Sharedmemory buffers.

    Args:
        name: The descriptive name to use for the shared memory array. The OS uses names to identify shared
            memory objects and have to be unique.
        shape: The shape of the shared numpy array.
        datatype: The datatype of the shared numpy array.
        buffer: The shared memory buffer that stores the data of the array and enables accessing the same data from
            different Python processes.

    Attributes:
        _name: Stores the name of the shared memory object.
        _shape: Stores the shape of the numpy array used to represent the buffered data.
        _datatype: Stores the datatype of the numpy array used to represent the buffered data.
        _buffer: The Shared Memory buffer object used to store the shared array data.
        _lock: A Lock object used to prevent multiple processes from working with the shared array data at the same
            time.
        _array: Stores the connected shared numpy array.
        _is_connected: Tracks whether the shared memory array wrapped by this class has been connected to.

        This method uses the input prototype to generate a new numpy array that uses a shared memory buffer to store
        its data. It then extracts the information required to connect to the buffer and reinitialize the array in
        a different Python process and saves it to class attributes.

        Notes:
            This method should only be called when the array is first created in the main process (scope). All
            child processes should use the connect() method to connect to the existing array.

        Args:
            name: The name to give to the created SharedMemory object. Note, this name has to be unique across all
                processes using the array.
            prototype: The numpy ndarray instance to serve as the prototype for the created SharedMemoryArray.
                Currently, this class only works with flat (one-dimensional) numpy arrays. If you want to use it for
                multidimensional arrays, consider using np.ravel() or np.ndarray.flatten() methods to flatten your
                array.
            exist_ok: Determines how the method handles the case where the Sharedmemory buffer with the same name
                already exists. If the flag is False, the class will raise an exception and abort SharedMemoryArray
                creation. If the flag is True, the class will destroy the old buffer and recreate the new buffer using
                the vacated name.

            The configured SharedMemoryArray class instance. This instance should be passed to each of the processes

        This method will only work if the current instance is NOT connected to the buffer.

        Notes:
            This method does not do anything on Windows. Windows automatically garbage-collects the buffers as long as
