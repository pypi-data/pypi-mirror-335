class NestedDictionary:
    """Wraps a nested (hierarchical) python dictionary and provides methods for manipulating its values.

    This class is primarily designed to abstract working with nested dictionaries without a-priori knowledge of
    dictionary layout. For example, when using data logging methods that produce nested .json or .yml files that can be
    parsed into dictionaries, the data can subsequently be wrapped and processed using this class. Alternatively, this
    class is used in AtaraxisData class to provide a compressed map of the data stored as the unified hdf data to
    optimize data access and manipulation.

    Notes:
        All class methods that modify the wrapped dictionary can be used to either modify the dictionary in-place or to
        return a new NestedDictionary class instance that wraps the modified dictionary.

        While this class will work for both nested and shallow (one-level) dictionaries, it would be inefficient to
        leverage the class machinery for non-nested dictionaries. For shallow dictionaries, using pure python
        methods is preferred.

    Attributes:
        _valid_datatypes: Stores supported dictionary key datatypes as a tuple. The class is guaranteed to recognize
            and work with these datatypes. This variable is used during input checks and for error messages related to
            key datatype conversion errors.
        _nested_dictionary: Stores the managed dictionary object. This object should never be accessed directly!
        _path_delimiter: Stores the sequence used to separate path nodes for input and output dictionary variable paths.
            The paths are used for purposes like accessing specific nested values.
        _key_datatypes: A set that stores the unique string names for the datatypes used by the keys in the dictionary.
            The datatype names are extracted from the __name__ property of the keys, so the class should be able to
            recognize more or less any type of keys. That said, support beyond the standard key datatypes listed in
            valid_datatypes is not guaranteed.

    Args:
        seed_dictionary: The 'seed' dictionary object to be used by the class. If not provided, the class will generate
            an empty shallow dictionary and use that as the initial object. This argument allows to re-initialize nested
            dictionaries when they are loaded from .yaml or .json files, by passing loaded dictionaries as seeds.
        path_delimiter: The delimiter used to separate keys in string variable paths. It is generally advised
            to stick to the default delimiter for most use cases. Only use custom delimiter if any of the dictionary or
            sub-dictionary keys reserve default delimiter for other purposes (for example, if the delimiter is part of a
            string key). Note, all methods in the class refer to this variable during runtime, so all inputs to the
            class have to use the class delimiter where necessary to avoid unexpected behavior.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If input arguments are not of the supported type.
