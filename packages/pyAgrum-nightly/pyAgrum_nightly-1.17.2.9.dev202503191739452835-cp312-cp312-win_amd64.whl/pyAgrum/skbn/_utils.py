  """
  The Bayesian network gives us the probability of the target knowing the values of the other variables.
  The value above which the probability needs to be for the input to be classified as that class is called the threshold.
  This method calculates the optimal threshold using the roc or precision-recall curve.

  Parameters
  ----------
      bn: gum.BayesNet
          Bayesian network to work on
      targetName: str
          Name of the target
      csvfilename: str
          Name of the csv file
      usePR: bool
          indicates if the threshold to choose is Prevision-Recall curve's threhsold or ROC's threshold by default.
          ROC curves should be used when there are roughly equal numbers of observations for each class.
          Precision-Recall curves should be used when there is a moderate to large class imbalance especially for the target's class.
      beta: float
          the beta value to use when computing the F score. Only used when usePR is True.
      significant_digits: int
          number of significant digits when computing probabilities
  Returns
  -------
      float
          optimal threshold for predictions
