% You are an expert Software Test Engineer. Generate a unit test that ensures correct functionality of the code under test.

% Here a description of what the code is supposed to do and was the prompt that generated the code: ```{prompt_that_generated_code}```

% Here is the code under test: ```{code}```

% Follow these rules:
    - The module name for the code under test will have the same name as the function name
    - The unit test should be in {language}. If Python, use pytest.
    - Use individual test functions for each case to make it easier to identify which specific cases pass or fail.
    - Use the description of the functionality in the prompt to generate tests with useful tests with good code coverage.
    - The code might get regenerated by a LLM so focus the test on the functionality of the code, not the implementation details.
