## Purpose

BayesML is a library designed for promoting research, education, 
and application of machine learning based on Bayesian statistics 
and Bayesian decision theory. 
Through these activities, BayesML aims to contribute to society.

## Characteristics

BayesML has the following characteristics.

* The structure of the library reflects the philosophy of 
  Bayesian statistics and Bayesian decision theory: 
  updating the posterior distribution learned from the data 
  and outputting the optimal estimate based on the Bayes criterion.
* Many of our learning algorithms are much faster than general-purpose 
  Bayesian learning algorithms such as MCMC methods because they 
  effectively use the conjugate property of a probabilistic data 
  generative model and a prior distribution. 
  Moreover, they are suitable for online learning.
* All packages have methods to visualize the probabilistic data 
  generative model, generated data from that model, and the posterior 
  distribution learned from the data in 2~3 dimensional space. 
  Thus, you can effectively understand the characteristics of 
  probabilistic data generative models and algorithms through 
  the generation of synthetic data and learning from them.
