#
#  This example demonstrates the warm up phase of the ENS160. After the "burn-in" phase 
#  the readings from the ENS160 will be more accurate. Before any data is given, the  
#  the sensor waits for the status flag to return "Initial Start Up" or "Normal Operation".
#  This time take approximately three minutes.
