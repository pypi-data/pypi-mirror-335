# qwiic_ens160_ex4_BME280_temp_rh_compensation.py
#
#  This example shows how to give the ENS160 Temperature and Relative Humidity
#  Data for compensation with the BME280. Note that the values that are given for compensation are not
#  populated in their registers until the Air Quality Sensor is set to "Standard" operation
#  and when data is ready (i.e. the data ready bit is set). Also note that there will be some 
#  rounding of the temperature and relative humidity values when they're given to the sensor
#  and again when they're read back.
