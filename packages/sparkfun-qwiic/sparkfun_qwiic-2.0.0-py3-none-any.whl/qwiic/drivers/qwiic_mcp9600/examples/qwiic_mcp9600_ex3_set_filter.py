# qwiic_mcp9600_ex3_set_filter.py
#
#   This example outputs the ambient and thermocouple temperatures from the MCP9600 sensor, but allows the filtering
#   onboard the MCP9600 to be controlled. The MCP9600 implements an exponential running average filter, the
#   "strength" of which is programmable! The setFilterCoefficient function takes a coefficient between 0 and 7, 
#   where 0 disables the filter, 1 corresponds to minimum filtering, and 7 enables maximum filtering. The "strength"
#   of the filter just refers to how long it takes for the filter to respond to a step function input. 

#   Quick Note! For some reason the getFilterCoefficient() function is a little wierd about returning the proper
#   data. This is a known issue and while we've done our best to fix it, every once in a while it might return a 0,
#   or the wrong value entirely. We think this is an issue with the MCP9600, and there's not much we can do about it.
#   If you'd like to learn more or contact us, check out this issue on GitHub!
