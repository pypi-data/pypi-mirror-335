# qwiic_mcp9600_ex5_burst_mode.py
#
#   This example configures the shutdown (or "operating") mode that the MCP9600 runs in. Shutdown mode disables all
#   power consuming activities on the MCP9600, including measurements, but it will still respond to I2C commands sent
#   over Qwiic. Burst mode is similar, where the MCP9600 is shutdown until the Arduino asks it to wake up and take a 
#   number of samples, apply any filtering, update any outputs, and then enter shutdown mode. This example walks
#   through that process!
