#
#   This example shows how to output ADC values on multiple channels.
  
#   It is based on the example provided by @StefanThoresson in Issue #6:
#   https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_ADS1015_Arduino_Library/issues/6
#   Thank you Stefan.
  
#   We used this example to determine the delay values for conversionDelay.
