# qwiic_ads1015_ex3_address.py
#
#   This example shows how to output ADC values on one single-ended channel (A3) with a NON-default address.
#   This is useful if you'd like to connect multiple ADS1015 boards on the same bus.
#   Note, you must cut a trace on the product hardware and solder to "0x49" jumper for this code to work.
