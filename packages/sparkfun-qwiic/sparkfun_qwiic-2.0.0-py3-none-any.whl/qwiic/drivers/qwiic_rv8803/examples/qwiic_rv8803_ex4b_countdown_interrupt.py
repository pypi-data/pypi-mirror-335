	# (4 options: 4096 Hz, 64 Hz, 1 Hz, 1/60 Hz)

	#   The time ranges covered by each freqeuncy setting are as follows
	#   4096 Hz: 244.14 uS - .9998 Second;                            244.14 uS per LSB             COUNTDOWN_TIMER_FREQUENCY_4096_HZ

	# We'll choose 60 Hz as our frequency as we want something > 1 second, 
	# but still want enough granularity to fire an interrupt at 3.5 seconds, not 3 or 4.
	# Since the resolution for this setting is 15.625 mS per LSB, we'll convert 3.5 seconds to 3500 ms. 
	# We'll then simply divide the time we want by the resolution to get the number of clock ticks we need to wait to fire the interrupt
