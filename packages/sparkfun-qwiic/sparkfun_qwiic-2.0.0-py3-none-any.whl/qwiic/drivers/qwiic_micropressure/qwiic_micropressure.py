============
Python module for the [SparkFun Qwiic MicroPressure Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16476)
This is a port of the existing [Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_MicroPressure_Arduino_Library)
This package can be used with the overall [SparkFun Qwiic Python Package](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Py)
New to Qwiic? Take a look at the entire [SparkFun Qwiic ecosystem](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic).
