#
#   This example shows how to output ADC values on one single-ended channel (A3).
#   It will also print out the voltage of the reading in mV.
#   Note, the conversion multiplier needs to be corrected for gain settings,
#   And this is done automatically in the library, using .getMultiplier(),
#   as shown below.
  
#   *at gain setting of 1, like in this example (and 3.3V VCC), 0-3.3V will read 0-1652.
