# qwiic_ads1015_ex2_change_gain.py
#
#   This example shows how to output ADC values on one single-ended channel (A3) with a PGA GAIN of 1. 
#   At this gain setting (and 3.3V VCC), 0-3.3V will read 0-1652.

#   Other possible gain settings are as follows. 
#   Note, changing the gain effects the range of the sensor (aka the max and min voltages it can read).
#   Also note, to avoid damaging your ADC, never exceed VDD (3.3V for a qwiic system).

#   ADS1015_CONFIG_PGA_TWOTHIRDS  +/- 6.144v
#   ADS1015_CONFIG_PGA_1          +/- 4.096v (used in this example)
#   ADS1015_CONFIG_PGA_2          +/- 2.048v
#   ADS1015_CONFIG_PGA_4          +/- 1.024v
#   ADS1015_CONFIG_PGA_8          +/- 0.512v
#   ADS1015_CONFIG_PGA_16         +/- 0.256v
