	# begin() has three boolean parameters:
   	# measBegin: set to true to begin periodic measurements automatically;
    #            set to false to leave periodic measurements disabled.
    #            Default is true.
   	# autoCalibrate: set to true to leave automatic calibration enabled;
    #                set to false to disable automatic calibration.
    #                Default is true.
   	# skipStopPeriodicMeasurements: set to true to make begin() skip the initial call of stopPeriodicMeasurement;
    #                               set to false to make begin() stop periodic measurements before doing anything else.
    #                               Default is false.

	# When periodic measurements are enabled, the SCD4x will only repond to:
	# readMeasurement; stopPeriodicMeasurement; setAmbientPressure; and getDataReadyStatus. All other commands are ignored.
	
	# Because begin() uses getSerialNumber to check if the SCD4x is connected, begin() would fail if a previous example had
	# left periodic measurements enabled. So, by default, begin() will call stopPeriodicMeasurement before calling
	# getSerialNumber. The down side to this is that stopPeriodicMeasurement takes 500ms to complete, incorporating a
	# blocking call of delay(500). If the user is confident that periodic measurements are already disabled,
	# skipStopPeriodicMeasurements can be set to true to skip the initial call of stopPeriodicMeasurement.
	# In this example, we will tell begin() to: enable periodic measurements; enable auto calibration;
	# and skip the initial stopPeriodicMeasurement to save that 500ms delay.
	# Instead we can manually call stopPeriodicMeasurement first:
	
	#It is OK to call stopPeriodicMeasurement before begin()
	mySCD4x.stop_periodic_measurement()

	# Now we call begin() and set skipStopPeriodicMeasurement to true
