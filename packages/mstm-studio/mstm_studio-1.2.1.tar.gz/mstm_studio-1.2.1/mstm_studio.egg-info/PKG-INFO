The graphical user interface and python scripts
    for calculation of optical extinction spectra of
    spherical particles used to study plasmonic
    nanoparticles.
    The binding to Multiple Spheres T-matrix (MSTM) code
    allows to simulate 'plasmonic' intercation between
    sphericl particles.
    Package allows basic analysis and fitting of experimental
    optical extinction spectra.
