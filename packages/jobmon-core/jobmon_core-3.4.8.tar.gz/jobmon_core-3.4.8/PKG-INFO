# JobMon Core

## Introduction

JobMon is a Python package developed by IHME's Scientific Computing team,
designed to simplify and standardize the process of job monitoring and
workflow management in computational projects.
It facilitates the tracking of job statuses, manages dependencies,
and streamlines the execution of complex workflows across various computing environments.

This package contains the code that it is shared between the client and the server, and
is deployed to the customer's worked node. 

See also the main documentation at [readthedocs](https://jobmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#).
