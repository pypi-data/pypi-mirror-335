# This is pkg-test-random

NOTE: before giving the name to packge please check whether package name is available or not to upload

1. Install Required Tools
Make sure you have twine and build installed:

bash
pip install -f twine build

2. Build Your Package
Navigate to your project folder and run:

python -m build

3. Create a PyPI Account
Go to PyPI and sign up.

    1. Enable 2FA on PyPI
    Go to PyPI Account Settings.

    Under "Two-factor Authentication", enable TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords).

    Scan the QR code with an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Authy).

    Enter the generated 6-digit code to confirm.

    2. Generate an API Token
    After enabling 2FA, go back to Account Settings.

    Scroll down to "API tokens" and click "Add API Token".

    Give it a name (e.g., mypackage-publish).

    Copy the generated token immediately, as it wonâ€™t be shown again.

    Generate an API token under Account Settings.

4. Upload the Package
    1. Run the following command and enter your credentials when prompted:
    bash
    twine upload dist/*

    2. If using an API token, run:
    bash
    twine upload dist/* -u __token__ -p YOUR_API_TOKEN
    
    3. For security, you can store the token in ~/.pypirc:

    [distutils]
        index-servers =
            pypi

    [pypi]
        username = __token__
        password = YOUR_API_TOKEN

    Once you've stored the API token in ~/.pypirc, you can upload your package without manually entering credentials by running:
    bash
    twine upload dist/*

    Since twine automatically reads the credentials from ~/.pypirc, it will use the stored API token without requiring manual input.
