# Methods of a CocoIndex Flow

After a flow is defined as discussed in [Flow Definition](/docs/core/flow_def), you get a Flow object and can call its methods to operate with it.

## update

The `update()` method will update will update the index defined by the flow.

Once the function returns, the indice is fresh up to the moment when the function is called.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
flow.update()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
