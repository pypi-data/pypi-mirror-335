**`sleepydatapeek`** has entered the chat!

Quickly summarize data files such as:
- `csv`
- `parquet`
- `json`
- `pkl`

If you have thoughts on how to make the tool more pragmatic, submit a PR 😊.

To add support for more data/file types:
1. append extension name to `supported_formats` in `sleepydatapeek_toolchain.params.py`
2. add detection logic branch to the `main` function in `sleepydatapeek_toolchain/command_logic.py`
3. update this readme
