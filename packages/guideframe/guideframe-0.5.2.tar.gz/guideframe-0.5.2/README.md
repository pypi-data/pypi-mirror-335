# GuideFrame

A walkthrough video generation tool created for the final project module on the HDip in Computer Science SETU 

## Installation

GuideFrame is packaged and available on pypi. It can be installed using:

```pip install guideframe```

Once installed, you will need to install the non-python dependencies. A setup script is packaged with GuideFrame for this. You can simply copy it from the GuideFrame repo and run it locally or you can run the following:

```bash $(python -c "import guideframe, os; print(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(guideframe.__file__), 'setup_env.sh'))")```

In aid of illustrating the basics of GuideFrame, a template repository has been created and can be found here:
https://github.com/chipspeak/GuideFrame-Template

This repository walks a user through the installation process in addition to providing some basics around the workings of GuideFrame in addition to some basic templates.
