class Fast:
    """
    Fast method for temporal disaggregation using a fixed smoothing parameter.

    This method uses a fixed value of rho (0.9) and a structure similar to
    the Litterman model, offering a quick approximation with reduced computational cost.
    """

    def estimate(self, y_l, X, C):
        """
        Estimates the high-frequency series using a fast disaggregation approach.

        Parameters:
            y_l (np.ndarray): Low-frequency target series.
            X (np.ndarray): High-frequency indicator series.
            C (np.ndarray): Conversion matrix.

        Returns:
