class Uniform:
    """
    Uniform method for temporal disaggregation.

    Applies a uniform weighting structure without imposing temporal correlation,
    adjusting the residuals proportionally across high-frequency periods.
    """

    def estimate(self, y_l, X, C):
        """
        Estimates the high-frequency series using a uniform disaggregation approach.

        Parameters:
            y_l (np.ndarray): Low-frequency target series.
            X (np.ndarray): High-frequency indicator series.
            C (np.ndarray): Conversion matrix.

        Returns:
