class OLS:
    """
    Ordinary Least Squares method for temporal disaggregation.

    This method applies standard OLS estimation using the aggregated indicators
    and low-frequency targets without incorporating temporal correlation or smoothing.

        """
        Estimates the high-frequency series using an OLS-based approach.

        Parameters:
            y_l (np.ndarray): Low-frequency target series.
            X (np.ndarray): High-frequency indicator series.
            C (np.ndarray): Conversion matrix.
