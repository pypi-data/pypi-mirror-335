class Denton:
    """
    Classic Denton method for temporal disaggregation.

    Minimizes the volatility of period-to-period changes in the adjusted
    high-frequency series while ensuring consistency with the low-frequency aggregates.
    """

    def estimate(self, y_l, X, C, h=1):
        """
        Estimates the high-frequency series using the Denton method.

        Parameters:
            y_l (np.ndarray): Low-frequency target series.
            X (np.ndarray): High-frequency indicator series.
            C (np.ndarray): Conversion matrix.
            h (int): Degree of differencing for volatility penalty (default: 1).

        Returns:
            np.ndarray: High-frequency estimate that preserves low-frequency totals.
