class Fernandez:
    """
    Fernandez method for temporal disaggregation.

    Uses an autoregressive-like structure to extrapolate high-frequency estimates
    from a low-frequency target while minimizing the second-order differences.
    """

    def estimate(self, y_l, X, C):
        """
        Estimates the high-frequency series using the Fernandez method.

        Parameters:
            y_l (np.ndarray): Low-frequency target series.
            X (np.ndarray): High-frequency indicator series.
            C (np.ndarray): Conversion matrix.

        Returns:
            np.ndarray: High-frequency estimate.
