class DentonCholette:
    """
    Denton-Cholette method for temporal disaggregation.

    This method applies a smoothing transformation to the residuals between
    the target aggregate and the extrapolated high-frequency series, minimizing
    the volatility of changes while preserving the low-frequency constraints.
    """

    def estimate(self, y_l, X, C, h=1):
        """
        Estimates the high-frequency series using the Denton-Cholette method.

        Parameters:
            y_l (np.ndarray): Low-frequency target series.
            X (np.ndarray): High-frequency indicator series.
            C (np.ndarray): Conversion matrix.
            h (int): Degree of differencing used for penalization (default: 1).

        Returns:
            np.ndarray: High-frequency estimate adjusted for smoothness and coherence.
