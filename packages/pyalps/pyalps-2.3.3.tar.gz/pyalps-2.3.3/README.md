### Installation instruction

1. Prerequisites
  - CMake > 3.18
  - Boost sources >= 1.76
  - BLAS/LAPACK
  - HDF5
  - MPI
  - Python >= 3.9
    - Python 3.13 requires Boost version 1.87 or later
    - Earlier versions maybe also work but unsupported
  - C++ compiler (build has been tested on GCC 10.5, GCC 11.4, GCC 12.3 and GCC 13.2)
  - GNU Make or Ninja build system

You need to download and unpack boost library:
```
wget https://archives.boost.io/release/1.86.0/source/boost_1_86_0.tar.gz
tar -xzf boost_1_86_0.tar.gz
```
Here we download `boost v1.86.0`, we have tested ALPS with versions `1.76.0` and `1.86.0`.

2. Downloading and building sources
```
git clone https://github.com/alpsim/ALPS ALPS
cmake -S ALPS -B alps_build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=</path/to/install/dir> \
      -DBoost_SRC_DIR=`pwd`/boost_1_86_0                                 \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-std=c++14 -fpermissive"
cmake --build alps_build -j 8
cmake --build alps_build -t test
```
This will download the most recent version of ALPS from the github repository, build it, and run unit tests.

3. Installation
```
cmake --build alps_build -t install
```
