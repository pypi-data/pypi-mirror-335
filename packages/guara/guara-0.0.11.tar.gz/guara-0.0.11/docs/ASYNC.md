# Asynchronous execution
Guar√° is the Python implementation of the design pattern `Page Transactions`. It is more of a programming pattern than a tool. It can be bound to any web driver other than Selenium.

As it can be bound to any Web Driver it can be associated with asynchronous drivers like [Caqui](https://github.com/douglasdcm/caqui). The core of the framework was extended to allow it. The UML diagrams of the asynchronous classes are

Notice the introduction of the `perform` method. It is necessary to run the chain of built-in methods `at` and `asserts`. It calls the list of coroutines. If it is not executed, then the built-in methods are not `waited`.

The built-in classes `OpenApp` and `CloseApp` are here just for compatibility with the synchronous design, but it is not implemented and not bound to any driver. Testers need to choose it by themselves.

There is a subtle change in `asserts` method. In this design the `actual` is an `AbstractTransaction`. Internally the method gets the `AbstractTransaction.result` and compares it against the expected value.
