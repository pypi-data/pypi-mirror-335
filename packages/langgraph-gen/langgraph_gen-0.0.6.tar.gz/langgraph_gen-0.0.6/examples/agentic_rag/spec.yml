# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with an agent.
# 1. The agent has access to one or more retrieval tools to retrieve relevant information.
# 2. The agent checks whether the retrieved information is relevant.
#   - If not, it attempts to rewrite the query and retrieve again.
#   - If yes, it generates the final output.
