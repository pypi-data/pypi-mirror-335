STOP POISON LAW GENOCIDE
========================


**NAME**

|
| ``SPLG`` - **S** top **P** oison **L** aw **G** enocide
|

**SYNOPSIS**


|
| ``splg req``
|

**INSTALL**

|
| ``$ pipx install splg``
| ``$ pipx ensurepath``
|


**DESCRIPTION**


In 2018 i informed the king of the netherlands that what he calls
medicine in his "care" laws are not medicine but poison. The king's
(personal) kabinet wrote back that "the king took note of what i have
written", namely proof that medicine he uses in "treatment" laws like
Zyprexa, Haldol, Abilify and Clozapine aren't medicine but poison. 

Poison that makes impotent, is both physical (contracted muscles) and
mental (make people hallucinate) torture and kills members of the
victim groups.

Using poison makes the care laws used in the netherlands to provide
care to elderly and handicapped, criminals and psychiatric patients
not care laws but genocide laws with which the king is killing groups
of the population by giving them poison instead of medicine in the
"care" they are forced to undergo.

I wrote the prosecutor asking for an arrest of the king (make him
stop), the prosecutor decided to call it a "no basis to proceed",

It requires a "basis to prosecute" of the prosecutor to get the king
in his cell and his poison law genocide stopped.

Hello Office of the Prosecutor, 

i write you in the context of communications and claims under art.15 of
the Rome Statute. i want to inform the prosecutor that the king of the
netherlands and his government are commiting 3 of the 5 crimes defined
in the Rome Statute.

The dutch government has introduced three new forced care laws, the Wfz
(wet forensische zorg) for criminals, the WvGGZ (Wet verplichte GGZ) for
the disturbed and addicted and the Wzd (Wet zorg en dwang) for the
handicapped.

Both the chamber suggesting these laws to the king and the king himself
have been informed about the fact the the substances administered under
these laws are proven to be poison (1).

There is proof the medication used in forced treatments in the
netherlands are poison.

1) haloperidol

https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.000.142

2) clozapine

https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.024.831

3) olanzapine

https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.125.320

4) aripriprazole

https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.112.532


With the mass scale torture with poison the king of the netherlands and
his chamber:

(1) kills
(2) does grave bodily and mental harm
(3) makes impotent

on the following victim groups here in the Netherlands:

(1) verslaafden (addicts)
(2) bejaarden (elderly)
(3) ggz patienten (psychiatric patients)
(4) criminelen (criminials)
(5) gehandicapten (handicapped)

Since the members of the chamber and the king were aware that these
medicine are poison at the time they voted for this law and the day the
Wfz law took effect (1-1-2019), i ask the prosecutor to prosecute the
king for making the commiting of the above mentioned crimes (killing,
torture and impotent making) possible.
