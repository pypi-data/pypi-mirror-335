## Types of Contributions

You can contribute in many ways:

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at [https://github.com/Jeck-ai/upsunvalidator/issues](https://github.com/Jeck-ai/upsunvalidator/issues).

If you are reporting a bug, please complete the issue template and include:

- Your operating system name and version.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- If you can, provide detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
- If you don't have steps to reproduce the bug, just note your observations in as much detail as you can.
  Questions to start a discussion about the issue are welcome.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs.
Anything tagged with the "bug" label is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features.
Anything tagged with "enhancement" and "please-help" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Please do not combine multiple feature enhancements into a single pull request.

### Adding example configuration

This is the most saught after contribution type for this project. 
This libary will improve in its ability to validate configuration and communicate the specifics of Upsun configuration to MCP tools better as more examples are to it.

Assuming you have first followed the [setting up for local development](#setting-up-the-code-for-local-development) instructions below,

1. Create a configuration file for the example

   ```bash
   mkdir -p upsunvalidator/examples/<YOUR EXAMPLE NAME>/.upsun
   touch upsunvalidator/examples/<YOUR EXAMPLE NAME>/.upsun/config.yaml
   ```

2. Add description for the example to the `examples/meta.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   ...
   laravel: Laravel PHP framework
   your-example: A Description of the framework that will surface in the MCP server.
   magentoce: Magento Community Edition e-commerce platform
   ...
   ```

### Write Documentation

Upsun Validator could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official Cookiecutter docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

<!-- If you want to review your changes on the documentation locally, you can do:

```bash
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
make servedocs
```

This will compile the documentation, open it in your browser and start watching the files for changes, recompiling as you save. -->

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at [https://github.com/Jeck-ai/upsunvalidator/issues](https://github.com/Jeck-ai/upsunvalidator/issues).

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

## Setting Up the Code for Local Development

Here's how to set up `upsunvalidator` for local development.

1. Fork the `upsunvalidator` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/upsunvalidator.git
   ```

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv.
   Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development:

   ```bash
   cd upsunvalidator
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -e .
   ```

   As you make changes to core, you will likely need to run `pip install -e .` again to test your revisions.

4. Create a branch for local development:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

   While not the primary use case, you can use the `upsunvalidator` CLI as a quick way to test changes that you make.
   Run the command `upsunvalidator --help` for available commands.

Now you can make your changes locally. 

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests and lint check:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

<!-- 6. Ensure that your feature or commit is fully covered by tests. Check report after regular `tox` run.
   You can also run coverage only report and get html report with statement by statement highlighting:

   ```bash
   make coverage
   ```

   You report will be placed to `htmlcov` directory. Please do not include this directory to your commits.
   By default this directory in our `.gitignore` file. -->

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
   git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Contributor Guidelines

### Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. The pull request should be contained:
   if it's too big consider splitting it into smaller pull requests.
3. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
   Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.md.
4. The pull request must pass all CI/CD jobs before being ready for review.
5. If one CI/CD job is failing for unrelated reasons you may want to create another PR to fix that first.

<!-- ### Coding Standards

- PEP8
- Functions over classes except in tests
- Quotes via [http://stackoverflow.com/a/56190/5549](http://stackoverflow.com/a/56190/5549)

  - Use double quotes around strings that are used for interpolation or that are natural language messages
  - Use single quotes for small symbol-like strings (but break the rules if the strings contain quotes)
  - Use triple double quotes for docstrings and raw string literals for regular expressions even if they aren't needed.
  - Example:

    ```python
    LIGHT_MESSAGES = {
        'English': "There are %(number_of_lights)s lights.",
        'Pirate':  "Arr! Thar be %(number_of_lights)s lights."
    }
    def lights_message(language, number_of_lights):
        """Return a language-appropriate string reporting the light count."""
        return LIGHT_MESSAGES[language] % locals()
    def is_pirate(message):
        """Return True if the given message sounds piratical."""
        return re.search(r"(?i)(arr|avast|yohoho)!", message) is not None
    ```

## Testing with tox

`tox` uses `pytest` under the hood, hence it supports the same syntax for selecting tests.

For further information please consult the [pytest usage docs](http://pytest.org/en/latest/example/index.html).

To run a particular test class with `tox`:

```bash
tox -e py310 -- '-k TestFindHooks'
```

To run some tests with names matching a string expression:

```bash
tox -e py310 -- '-k generate'
```

Will run all tests matching "generate", test_generate_files for example.

To run just one method:

```bash
tox -e py310 -- '-k "TestFindHooks and test_find_hook"'
```

To run all tests using various versions of Python, just run `tox`:

```bash
tox
```

This configuration file setup the pytest-cov plugin and it is an additional dependency.
It generate a coverage report after the tests.

It is possible to test with specific versions of Python. To do this, the command is:

```bash
tox -e py37,py38
```

This will run `py.test` with the `python3.7` and `python3.8` interpreters. -->
