# SlipDeck 🎴📦

SlipDeck is an open-source Python utility built specifically for Trading Card Game (TCG) sellers. Easily transform your order details from TCGPlayer into professional, 4x6-compatible packing slips, sorted pull sheets, and labels.

**Other markets like eBay, Mercari and PriceCharting coming soon!**

SlipDeck helps you save money and streamline your shipping process—saving you valuable time and effort!

Happy selling & collecting! 🎴✨

## Save Money 💰
