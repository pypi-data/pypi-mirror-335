    This detector computes the Poynting flux (power flow) through a specified surface
    in the simulation volume. It can measure flux in either positive or negative
    direction along the propagation axis, and optionally reduce measurements to a
    single value by summing over the detection surface.

    Attributes:
        direction: Direction of flux measurement, either "+" for positive or "-" for
            negative along the propagation axis.
        reduce_volume: If True, reduces measurements to a single value by summing
            over the detection surface. If False, maintains spatial distribution.
