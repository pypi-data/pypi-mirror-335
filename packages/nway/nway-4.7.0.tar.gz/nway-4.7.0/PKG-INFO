nway
======================================

nway is a source cross-matching tool for arbitrarily many astronomical catalogues. 

Features
----------

* Bayesian match probabilities based on astronomical sky coordinates (RA, DEC)
* Works with arbitrarily many catalogues
* Can handle varying errors
* Can incorporate additional prior information, such as the magnitude or color distributions of the sources to match
* Works accurately and fast in small areas and all-sky catalogues

Documentation
---------------

See the manual in the doc/ folder, https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/nway/raw/master/doc/nway-manual.pdf

A full worked example with demo catalogues is included.

Installation
---------------

The easiest way to install nway is with pip::

	$ pip install nway

Add --user if you do not have admin privileges. Alternatively, 
download the source code and run "python setup.py install".

nway uses the following python packages:

* numpy, scipy, matplotlib
* astropy
* tqdm
* joblib
* healpy
* pandas

nway works with both Python 3 and Python 2 and various astropy versions.
