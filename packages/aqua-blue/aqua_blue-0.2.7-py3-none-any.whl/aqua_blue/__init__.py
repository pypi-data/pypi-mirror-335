# Examples

## üêá Basic Lotka-Volterra example

Below is an example of using `aqua-blue` to predict the Lotka-Volterra equations with initial parameters $\beta = 0.02$,
$\gamma = 0.3$, and $\delta = 0.01$, and initial parameters $(x_0, y_0) = (20, 9)$. We train a reservoir computer
with a dimensionality of $1000$ over $0\leq t\leq 10$, with $1000$ timesteps.

```py
.. include:: ../examples/lotka-volterra.py
```

## üïì Using datetime objects

Below is an example of a simple sine-cosine task similar to above, using `datetime.datetime` objects as `times`.

```py
.. include:: ../examples/sine-cosine.py
```

## üì° Load and output a JSON string

Below is an example of inputting a `json` string as the training data, and outputting a `json` string for the
prediction. This is particularly useful for interfacing `aqua-blue` with already-existing systems.

```py
.. include:: ../examples/json_example.py
```
