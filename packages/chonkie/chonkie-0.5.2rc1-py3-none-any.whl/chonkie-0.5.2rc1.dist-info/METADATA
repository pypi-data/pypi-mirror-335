Ever found yourself building yet another RAG bot (your 2,342,148th one), only to hit that all-too-familiar wall? You know the one ‚Äî‚Äî where you're stuck choosing between:

- Library X: A behemoth that takes forever to install and probably includes three different kitchen sinks
- Library Y: So bare-bones it might as well be a "Hello World" program
- Writing it yourself? For the 2,342,149th time, _sigh_

And you think to yourself:

> "WHY CAN'T THIS JUST BE SIMPLE?!" </br>
> "Why do I need to choose between bloated and bare-bones?" </br>
> "Why can't I just install, import, and CHONK?!" </br>

Well, look no further than Chonkie! (chonkie boi is a gud boi ü¶õüíï)

**üöÄ Feature-rich**: All the CHONKs you'd ever need </br>
**‚ú® Easy to use**: Install, Import, CHONK </br>
**‚ö° Fast**: CHONK at the speed of light! zooooom </br>
**üåê Wide support**: Supports all your favorite tokenizer CHONKS </br>
**ü™∂ Light-weight**: No bloat, just CHONK </br>
**ü¶õ Cute CHONK mascot**: psst it's a pygmy hippo btw </br>
**‚ù§Ô∏è [Moto Moto](#acknowledgements)'s favorite python library** </br>

**Chonkie** is a chunking library that "**just works‚Ñ¢**".

# Installation

To install chonkie, simply run:

```bash
pip install chonkie
```

Chonkie follows the rule to have minimal default installs, read the [DOCS](https://docs.chonkie.ai) to know the installation for your required chunker, or simply install `all` if you don't want to think about it (not recommended).

```bash
pip install chonkie[all]
```

# Usage

Here's a basic example to get you started:

```python
# First import the chunker you want from Chonkie 
from chonkie import TokenChunker

# Import your favorite tokenizer library
# Also supports AutoTokenizers, TikToken and AutoTikTokenizer
from tokenizers import Tokenizer 
tokenizer = Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Initialize the chunker
chunker = TokenChunker(tokenizer)

# Chunk some text
chunks = chunker("Woah! Chonkie, the chunking library is so cool! I love the tiny hippo hehe.")

# Access chunks
for chunk in chunks:
    print(f"Chunk: {chunk.text}")
    print(f"Tokens: {chunk.token_count}")
```

More example usages given inside the [DOCS](https://docs.chonkie.ai)

# Supported Methods

Chonkie provides several chunkers to help you split your text efficiently for RAG applications. Here's a quick overview of the available chunkers:

- **TokenChunker**: Splits text into fixed-size token chunks.
- **WordChunker**: Splits text into chunks based on words.
- **SentenceChunker**: Splits text into chunks based on sentences.
- **RecursiveChunker**: Splits text hierarchically using customizable rules to create semantically meaningful chunks.
- **SemanticChunker**: Splits text into chunks based on semantic similarity.
- **SDPMChunker**: Splits text using a Semantic Double-Pass Merge approach.
- **LateChunker (experimental)**: Embeds text and then splits it to have better chunk embeddings.

More on these methods and the approaches taken inside the [DOCS](https://docs.chonkie.ai)

# Benchmarks üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

> "I may be smol hippo, but I pack a punch!" ü¶õ

Here's a quick peek at how Chonkie performs:

**Size**üì¶

- **Default Install:** 15MB (vs 80-171MB for alternatives)
- **With Semantic:** Still lighter than the competition!

**Speed**‚ö°

- **Token Chunking:** 33x faster than the slowest alternative
- **Sentence Chunking:** Almost 2x faster than competitors
- **Semantic Chunking:** Up to 2.5x faster than others
