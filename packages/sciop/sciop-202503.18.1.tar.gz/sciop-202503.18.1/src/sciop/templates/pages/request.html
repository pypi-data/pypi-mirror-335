<h2>Request/Add a Dataset</h2>

<p>
Dataset requests can be submitted anonymously, but please create an account and log in
for this dataset to be associated with you and allow you to make edits and updates.
</p>

<p>
Datasets can be submitted whether you have a copy of the data or if you want
someone else to scrape it. If you have a copy of the dataset and have permission
to upload, you will be able to do so after submitting the dataset.
