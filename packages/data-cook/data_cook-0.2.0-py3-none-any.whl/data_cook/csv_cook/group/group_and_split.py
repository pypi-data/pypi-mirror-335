def group_and_split(df: pd.DataFrame, group_column, train_size=0.7, random_state=None):
    """
    Group the dataframe by a column and split each group into train and test sets.

    This function splits the dataframe into groups based on the given column(s).
    Then, for each group, it randomly splits the data into two subsets: training and testing.
    The training set will contain a proportion of data determined by the train_size argument.
    The remaining data will be included in the testing set.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): The input dataframe.
        group_column (str or list): The column(s) to group by.
        train_size (float): The proportion of the dataset to include in the train split.
        random_state (int): Random seed for reproducibility.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the train and test dataframes.
