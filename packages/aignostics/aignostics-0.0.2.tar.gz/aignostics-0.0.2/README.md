## Generate a new project

This template is designed to be used with the [copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) project generator. It allows you to create a new project based on this template and customize it according to your needs.
To generate a new project, follow these steps:

**Step 1**: Install uv package manager and copier. Copy the following code into your terminal and execute it.
```shell
if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]]; then                 # Install dependencies for macOS X
  if ! command -v brew &> /dev/null; then             ## Install Homebrew if not present
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  fi
elif [[ "$OSTYPE" == "linux-gnu"* ]]; then            # Install dependencies for Linux
  sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install curl -y # Install curl
fi
if ! command -v uvx &> /dev/null; then                # Install uv package manager if not present
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  source $HOME/.local/bin/env
fi
uv tool install copier                                # Install copier as global tool
```

**Step 2**: [Create a repository on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository), clone to your local machine, and change into it's directory.

**Step 3**: Generate the project. Copy
```shell
# ensure to stand in a git repository before executing the next command
copier copy --trust gh:helmut-hoffer-von-ankershoffen/oe-python-template .
```

**Step 4**: Perform initial commit and push. Copy the following code into your terminal and execute it.
```shell
git add .
git commit -m "chore: Initial commit"
git push
```

Visit your GitHub repository and check the Actions tab. The CI workflow should already be running! The workflow will fail at the SonarQube step, as this external service is not yet configured for our new repository.

**Step 5**: Follow the [instructions](SERVICE_CONNECTIONS.md) to wire up
external services such as CloudCov, SonarQube Cloud, Read The Docs, Docker.io, and Streamlit Community Cloud.

**Step 6**: Release the first versions
```shell
./n bump
```
Notes:
1. You can remove this section post having successfully generated your project.
2. The following sections refer to the dummy application and service provided by this template.
   Use them as inspiration and adapt them to your own project.

## Overview

Adding Aignostics Python SDK to your project as a dependency is easy. See below for usage examples.

```shell
uv add aignostics             # add dependency to your project
```

If you don't have uv installed follow [these instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). If you still prefer pip over the modern and fast package manager [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), you can install the library like this:


```shell
pip install aignostics        # add dependency to your project
```

Executing the command line interface (CLI) in an isolated Python environment is just as easy:

```shell
uvx aignostics hello-world       # prints "Hello, world! [..]"
uvx aignostics serve             # serves web API
uvx aignostics serve --port=4711 # serves web API on port 4711
```

Notes:
1. The API is versioned, mounted at `/api/v1` resp. `/api/v2`
2. While serving the web API go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/hello-world](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/hello-world) to see the respons of the `hello-world` operation.
3. Interactive documentation is provided at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs)


The CLI provides extensive help:

```shell
uvx aignostics --help                # all CLI commands
uvx aignostics hello-world --help    # help for specific command
uvx aignostics echo --help
uvx aignostics openapi --help
uvx aignostics serve --help
```

5. Compliant with modern linting and formatting standards (powered by [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff))
6. Up-to-date dependencies (monitored by [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [Dependabot](https://github.com/aignostics/python-sdk/security/dependabot))
7. [A-grade code quality](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=aignostics_python-sdk) in security, maintainability, and reliability with low technical debt and codesmell (verified by SonarQube)
8. Additional code security checks using [CodeQL](https://github.com/aignostics/python-sdk/security/code-scanning)
9. [Security Policy](SECURITY.md)
10. [License](LICENSE) compliant with the Open Source Initiative (OSI)
11. 1-liner for installation and execution of command line interface (CLI) via [uv(x)](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) or [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/helmuthva/aignostics-python-sdk/tags)
12. Setup for developing inside a [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) included (supports VSCode and GitHub Codespaces)
