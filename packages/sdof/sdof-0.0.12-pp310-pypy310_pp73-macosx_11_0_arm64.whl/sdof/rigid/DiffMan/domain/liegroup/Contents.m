% DiffMan - Lie groups
%
% The Lie groups implemented in the DiffMan toolbox are: 
% 
%  @lgdirprod  - The direct product of Lie groups.
%  @lggl       - The real and complex general linear group.
%  @lgon       - The (real) orthogonal group.
%  @lgon_pq    - The (real) pseudo-orthogonal group.
%  @lgrn       - The real and complex Lie group R^n.
%  @lgse       - The (real) special Euclidean group.
%  @lgsl       - The real and complex special linear group.
%  @lgso       - The (real) special othogonal group.
%  @lgso_pq    - The (real) special pseudo-othogonal group.
%  @lgsp       - The real and complex symplectic group.
%  @lgsu       - The (complex) special unitary group.
%  @lgtangent  - The tangent bundle of a Lie group.
%  @lgun       - The (complex) unitary group.
%  @liegroup   - The virtual superclass of all Lie groups.
