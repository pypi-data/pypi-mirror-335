.. _swh-deposit-prod-env:

Production deployment
=====================

The deposit is architectured around 3 parts:

  - server: a django application exposing an xml api, discussing with a postgresql
    backend (and optionally a keycloak instance)

  - worker(s): 1 worker service dedicated to check the deposit archive and metadata are
    correct (the checker), another worker service dedicated to actually ingest the
    deposit into the swh archive.

  - client: a python script ``swh deposit`` command line interface.

All those are packaged in 3 separated debian packages, created and uploaded to the swh
debian repository. The deposit server and workers configuration are managed by puppet
(cf. puppet-environment/swh-site, puppet-environment/swh-role,
puppet-environment/swh-profile)

In the following document, we will focus on the server actions that may be needed once
the server is installed or upgraded.


Prepare the database setup (existence, connection, etc...).
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is defined through the packaged module ``swh.deposit.settings.production`` and the
expected **/etc/softwareheritage/deposit/server.yml** configuration file.


Environment (production/staging)
--------------------------------

``SWH_CONFIG_FILENAME`` must be defined and target the deposit server configuration file.
So either 1. prefix the following commands or 2. export the environment variable in your
shell session. For the remaining part of the documentation, we assume 2. has been
configured.

.. code:: shell

    export SWH_CONFIG_FILENAME=/etc/softwareheritage/deposit/server.yml


Migrate the db schema
---------------------

The debian package may integrate some new schema modifications. To run them:

.. code:: shell

    sudo django-admin migrate --settings=swh.deposit.settings.production


.. _swh-deposit-add-client-and-collection:

Add client and collection
-------------------------

The deposit can be configured to use either the 1. django basic authentication framework
or the 2. swh keycloak instance. If the server uses 2., the password is managed by
keycloak so the option ``--password`` is ignored.

* basic

.. code:: shell

    swh deposit admin \
        --config-file $SWH_CONFIG_FILENAME \
        --platform production \
        user create \
        --collection <collection-name> \
        --username <client-name> \
        --password <to-define>

This adds a user ``<client-name>`` which can access the collection
``<collection-name>``. The password will be used for checking the authentication access
to the deposit api (if 1. is used).

Note:
  - If the collection does not exist, it is created alongside
  - The password, if required, is passed as plain text but stored encrypted


Reschedule a deposit
---------------------

If for some reason, the loading failed, after fixing and deploying the new deposit
loader, you can reschedule the impacted deposit through:

.. code:: shell

    swh deposit admin \
        --config-file $SWH_CONFIG_FILENAME \
        --platform production \
        deposit reschedule \
        --deposit-id <deposit-id>

This will:

- check the deposit's status to something reasonable (failed or done). That means that
  the checks have passed but something went wrong during the loading (failed: loading
  failed, done: loading ok, still for some reasons as in bugs, we need to reschedule it)
- reset the deposit's status to 'verified' (prior to any loading but after the checks
  which are fine) and removes the different archives' identifiers (swh-id, ...)
- trigger back the loading task through the scheduler


Integration checks
------------------

There exists icinga checks running periodically on `staging`_ and `production`_
instances. If any problem arises, expect those to notify the #swh-sysadm irc channel.
