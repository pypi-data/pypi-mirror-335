    r"""A kind of Tensor that should not be considered a model
    parameter. For example, BatchNorm's ``running_mean`` is not a parameter, but is part of the Cell's state.

    Buffers are :class:`~mindspore.Tensor` subclasses, that have a
    very special property when used with :class:`Cell` s -- when they're
    assigned as Cell attributes they are automatically added to the list of
    its buffers, and will appear e.g. in :meth:`~mindspore.nn.Cell.buffers` iterator.
    Assigning a Tensor doesn't have such effect. One can still assign a Tensor as explicitly by using
    the :meth:`~mindspore.nn.Cell.register_buffer` function.

    Args:
        data (Tensor): buffer tensor.
        persistent (bool, optional): whether the buffer is part of the Cell's
            :attr:`state_dict`. Default: ``True``
