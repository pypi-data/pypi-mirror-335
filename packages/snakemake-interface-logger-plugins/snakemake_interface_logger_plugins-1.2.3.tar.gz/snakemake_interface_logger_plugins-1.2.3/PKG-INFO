# Snakemake Logger Plugin Interface

This package provides a stable interface for interactions between Snakemake and its logger plugins.

It is recommended to use Snakemake's poetry plugin to set up this skeleton (and automated testing) within a python package, see https://github.com/snakemake/poetry-snakemake-plugin.

This interface is a work in progress and the skeleton code will be added below once the dust has settled.
