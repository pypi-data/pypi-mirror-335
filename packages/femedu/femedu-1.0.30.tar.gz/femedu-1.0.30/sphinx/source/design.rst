Program Design
******************

The goal is to create an object-oriented Finite Element Analysis program that

1. is based on the finite element method
#. handles arbitrary trusses in 2D
#. allows for arbitrary loading
#. can plot its undeformed and deformed shape

The program will need and use the following objects:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 3
