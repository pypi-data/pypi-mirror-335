# Python Component Fitting Tool  (pycfit)

Python program to replicate many spectral fitting functions of the CFIT system from SolarSoft IDL.  



# Installation

 `pip install pycfit` 
 

# Use
```python
#### Use interactive fitter to find an initial model based on an averaged spectra

from pycfit import cfit_gui
from pycfit.data import load_average_data

# Load sample data
avg_wavelength, avg_intensity, avg_uncertainty = load_average_data()

# Call the GUI fitter
model = cfit_gui(avg_wavelength, avg_intensity, uncertainty=avg_uncertainty)



#### Use the interactive viewer to fit each point of the raster to the initial model
#### and adjust or mask individual point fittings as needed

from pycfit import cfit_grid_gui
from pycfit.data import load_grid_data

# Load a small-patch of sample data
wavelength, intensity, uncertainty, mask = load_grid_data(patch=True)

# Call the GUI inspector/fitter
gridResults = cfit_grid_gui(model, wavelength, intensity, 
                uncertainty=uncertainty, mask=mask, 
                parallel=False)


```
