description: "MVCS architecture extends MVC by adding a Service layer for better separation of concerns. The controller handles HTTP requests, the model represents the data, the routes define the API endpoints, and the services contain the business logic."
folders:
  - controllers   # Contains controllers which handle HTTP requests and responses
  - models        # Contains the data models for interacting with the database
  - routes        # Defines the routes/endpoints for the API
  - services
  - utils      # Contains business logic and services used by the controllers
