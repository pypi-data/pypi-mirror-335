Set of PyMoDAQ plugins for cameras by Basler, using the pypylon library. It handles basic camera functionalities (gain, exposure, ROI).
The data is emitted together with spatial axes corresponding either to pixels or to real-world units (um). The pixel size of different camera model is hardcoded in the hardware/basler.py file.
If the camera model is not specified, the pixel size is set to 1 um and can be changed manually by the user in the interface.

The plugin was tested using an acA640-120gm camera. It is compatible with PyMoDAQ 4.4.7.
