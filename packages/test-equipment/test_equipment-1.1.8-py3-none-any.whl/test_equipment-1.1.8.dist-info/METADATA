# Test Equipment
This python module allows the user to control the following test equipment via a
USB connection. The test_equipment python module is primarily aimed at providing
an easy way of interfacing with test equipment.

## DC Power Supplies

- HMP2030 PSU
- TENMA 72-2550 PSU
- ETMXXXXP

The psu_ctrl command line tool is installed when this python package is installed.
It is not aimed at being a fully functional tool to control the power supplies but
to provide example code that details how a user may incorporate PSU control into
their applications.

Before using psu_ctrl to control power supplies the configuration must be set using
the 'psu_ctrl -c' command line options. This should be executed with the power supply
connected to the PC. The user should then set parameter 1 to set the power supply
type connected and set parameter 2 to set the PSU connection string.

Once configured the user can turn PSU outputs on/off and set voltages and current
limits.

Command line help is available for the psu_ctrl command line tool as shown below.

```
usage: psu_ctrl.py [-h] [-d] [-c] [-v VOLTS] [-a AMPS] [-o OUTPUT] [--on] [--off] [-r]

A description of what it does.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug           Enable debugging.
  -c, --config          Configure the PSU parameters.
  -v VOLTS, --volts VOLTS
                        Set PSU voltage (default=3.3).
  -a AMPS, --amps AMPS  Set PSU current limit (default=1.0).
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        The PSU output to use (default=1).
  --on                  Turn the output on.
  --off                 Turn the output off.
  -r, --read            Read the output current/power.

#### Shelly 1PM Plus Calibration.

If this device is to be used as test equipment it will need to be calibrated. The calibration process requires the following equipment.

- 2kW fan heater.
- R&S HM8112-3 Precision Multimeter to measure the AC voltage.
- OWON AC/DC Clamp Ammeter to measure the current.

The Shelly 1PM Plus should be connected with the fan heater connected to it's output, the 'R&S HM8112-3 Precision Multimeter' should be connected to measure the voltage and the 'OWON AC/DC Clamp Ammeter' should be 'clamped' across the Live wire between the 'Shelly 1PM Plus' unit and the fan heater.

To calibrate the 'Shelly 1PM Plus' you need the following information.

 --mac: The MAC address is the bluetooth MAC address of the 'OWON AC/DC Clamp Ammeter'. The cm2100b -l command can be used to obtain this as shown below.

```
cm2100b -l
INFO:  Scanning for CM2100B bluetooth devices...
INFO:  CM2100B MAC address: A6:C0:80:EF:82:35
```

 -p: This is the USB serial port that the 'R&S HM8112-3 Precision Multimeter' is connected to.

 -a: This is the IP address of the 'Shelly 1PM Plus' module on your WiFi network.

Once you have this information the following command can be used to calibrate the Shelly unit.

```
