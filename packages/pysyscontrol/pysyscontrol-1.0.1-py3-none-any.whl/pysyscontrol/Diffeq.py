class DiffEq:
    """
    A class for handling ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
    This class allows users to enter a differential equation in Lagrange
    notation, the way it would be written on paper, and converts it into a
    symbolic sympy expression.
    
    Note:
        This class only supports non-mixed ODEs.
        If a mixed ODE is required, multiple instances of this class should
        be created.

        Initializes the DiffEq class.
        
        Parameters:
            eq (str):
                The differential equation as a string.
                For correct conversion, follow these rules:
                    1. The equation should be enclosed in double quotes.
                    2. Use an asterisk (*) for multiplication.
                    3. For subtraction, use '+-' 
            func (str):
                The name of the function in the differential equation.
                Example: In "y' = 5*y", y is the name.
            var (str):
                The independent variable with respect to which differentiation
                occurs, default t.

                Symbolic representation of the independent variable.

                The function name.
            y (sympy Function):
                Symbolic representation of the function dependend on 't'.
            derivatives (list):
                A list indicating the order of derivatives in each term.
                See 'find_derivs()' for details.
            order (int):
                The highest order derivative in the equation
            K (list):
                A list that containing the numerical coefficients of each term.
