class LaplaceHandler():
    """
    A class for correctly computing the laplace transform of a differentail equation.
    
    This class properly handles the transformation of an ordinary differential
    equation (ODE) into the Laplace domain, ensuring the correct handling of
    functions and initial conditions.
    """
    def __init__(self, equation, name, var='t'):
        """
        Initializes the LaplaceHandler class.
        
        Parameters:
            equation (str):
                The differential equation to be transformed
            name:
                The name of the function in the equation, commonly 'y'
            var:
                The independent variable of the equation, default 't'
        
        Attributes:
            t (sympy Symbol):
                The independent variable before transforming
            s (sympy Symbol):
                The complex-valued laplace variable
            name (sympy Function):
                The function to be transformed
            lap_name (sympy Function):
                The name of the laplace-transformed function,
                capitalized version of 'name'.
            function (DiffEq object):
                A symbolic expression of the input equation (see Diffeq.py)
            equation:
                The differential equation converted to a sympy expression.
            initial_conds (numpy array):
                Initial conditions of the differential equations.
                In control theory, these are assumed to be zero, meaning the
                system is at rest before the input signal is applied.
            laplace_transform (sympy expression):
                The laplace transformed version of the input equation

        sympy's built in functions, while ensuring correct handling of initial
        conditions and function substitution.
