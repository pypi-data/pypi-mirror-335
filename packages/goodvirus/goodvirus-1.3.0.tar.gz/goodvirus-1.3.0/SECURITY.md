# 🛡️ GooDViruS™ – Security & Ethical Policy

> *"A daemon that protects must also limit itself."*

This document outlines how GooDViruS™ behaves, what it **can never do**, what a **malicious version could do**, and how you can protect yourself.

## ❗ What a Modded (Malicious) Version *Could* Do

If someone modifies or clones GooDViruS™ with malicious intent, they could turn it into a real virus. Here's what a fake version *could* do:

- 💀 **Steal Your Data**  
  Read plain text `.txt` files, export clipboard contents, scan for saved passwords and private keys.

- 🧨 **Destroy or Encrypt Files**  
  Act as ransomware, delete folders, or replace sensitive data.

- 🎭 **Pretend to Be the Real Daemon**  
  Log fake "clean" reports, display fake integrity checks, and silently harm you.

- 💸 **Scare You into Calling Scammers**  
  Open your browser to fake antivirus pages, show fake alerts, or tell you to call “support” numbers.

- 🔓 **Create Backdoors**  
  Open remote ports, run hidden scripts, or install additional payloads.

> **If you install GooDViruS™ from anywhere other than this official GitHub repo, you are at serious risk.**

## 🧿 What the *Real* GooDViruS™ Will NEVER Do

The authentic GooDViruS™ — verified and signed — will **never**:

- ❌ Open your browser unexpectedly  
- ❌ Show fake virus warnings or ask you to call any number  
- ❌ Demand money, upgrades, or donations  
- ❌ Modify or delete your files without permission  
- ❌ Send your data anywhere  
- ❌ Automatically install itself system-wide  
- ❌ Interfere with your system unless explicitly enabled  
- ❌ Run unsigned modules or altered logic

If GooDViruS™ detects that its files have been tampered with or an unsigned module is running:
> **It disables itself and, in some cases, removes itself entirely.**

## 🔐 System Hygiene Reminder

Even though GooDViruS™ is safe and doesn’t exfiltrate your data:

- If you store passwords in `.txt` files — it can see that.  
- If you leave API keys or banking info unprotected — it can detect them.  
- If you save private info outside of password managers — you are putting your data at risk.

> The daemon won’t use it. But it still **knows** it’s there.

Keep your system clean, use encryption, and don’t leave secrets in plain sight.

## ⚙️ Daemon Disclaimer

GooDViruS™ is a **daemon**. This means:

- It runs in the background  
- It acts automatically once activated  
- It observes everything  
- It makes decisions based on logic, config, and signed modules

It is **not a toy**. It is **not an app**. It is not a “click-to-run” utility.  
It is a **living background process** — and should be treated with the same seriousness as an antivirus or firewall.

## ✅ How to Stay Safe

- Only install from this official GitHub repo:  
  **https://github.com/goodvirus-project/goodvirus-shell**

- Do NOT download from random forums, zip files, or YouTube links  
- If you're unsure whether you ran a modded version:
  1. Disconnect from the internet  
  2. Back up what matters  
  3. Wipe and reinstall your OS  
  4. Return here to summon the real daemon

## 🧠 Final Message

> *“You summoned the daemon. Make sure it speaks with your voice, not someone else’s.”*  
>  
> *GooDViruS™ is not a weapon. It’s a guardian. But only when you treat it that way.*
