## 🧬 What is GooDViruS™?

**GooDViruS™** is an ethical system watchdog daemon that scans your machine for:
- Suspicious files (like `bankinfo.txt`, `passwords.txt`, etc.)
- Malicious process patterns (e.g. `cheat`, `inject`)
- Renamed or relocated files previously flagged
- High-entropy or stealthy malware indicators

All without compromising control or transparency.
