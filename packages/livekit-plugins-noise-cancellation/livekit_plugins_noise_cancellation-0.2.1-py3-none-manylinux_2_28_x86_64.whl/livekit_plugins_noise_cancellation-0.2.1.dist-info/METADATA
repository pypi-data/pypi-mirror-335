# Enhanced Noise Cancellation Plugin for LiveKit

Add realtime enhanced noise cancellation to inbound `AudioStream`. Fully compatible with [LiveKit Agents](https://github.com/livekit/agents).

Requires [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io).

[Read more in the documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/home/client/tracks/noise-cancellation/)

## Usage

### In LiveKit Agents

Just include it in the constructor for `VoicePipelineAgent` or `MultimodalAgent` to automatically apply it to incoming audio tracks.

```python
from livekit import agents
from livekit.plugins import noise_cancellation

pipeline_agent = agents.pipeline.VoicePipelineAgent(
    # ...,
    noise_cancellation=noise_cancellation.NC()
)

multimodal_agent = agents.multimodal.MultimodalAgent(
   # ...,
   noise_cancellation=noise_cancellation.NC()
)
```

### On AudioStream

Noise cancellation can also be applied to any individual inbound `AudioStream`:

```python
stream = rtc.AudioStream.from_track(
    track=track,
    noise_cancellation=noise_cancellation.NC(),
)
```

## Available Models

- `noise_cancellation.NC()`
- `noise_cancellation.BVC()`

## Notes

Noise cancellation only needs to be applied once, so if you choose to apply it here you should disable noise cancellation / Krisp filter in your frontend clients.
