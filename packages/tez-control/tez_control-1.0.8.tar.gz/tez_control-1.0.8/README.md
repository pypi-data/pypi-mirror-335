# Tez Control

Tez Control is a command-line tool that allows users to interact with and control remote servers, generate configuration files, and execute custom commands. It is designed to make server management and configuration setup simple and efficient.

## Features

- **Connect to Real Server**: Enter and interact with a remote server directly from your terminal.
- **Generate Configuration Files**: Automatically generate configuration files like `.service` and `nginx.conf` for your project.
- **Run Custom Commands On Server**: Execute commands on the server as per your project needs.
- **Run Custom Commands On Local**: Execute commands on the current local path.
  
## Installation

You can install `tez-control` via pip:

```bash
pip install tez-control
```

## Usage

### Entering the Real Server

Once you have `tez-control` installed, you can connect to a remote server with the following command:

```bash
tez sv
```

This will prompt you to enter your server's host, user, and password (configured in your settings). Once connected, you will have an interactive terminal where you can run shell commands on the server.

You can navigate directories, run commands, and even cancel a command with `Ctrl+C`. Type `exit` to disconnect from the server.


```bash
tez ex
```
### Configuration File (`.tez`)

`tez-control` uses a `.tez` configuration file to store connection details and project settings. The default location for this file is your home directory (`~/.tez`). Below is an example of what the file should look like:

```ini
[server]
SERVER_HOST=1.1.1.1
SERVER_USER=root
SERVER_PASSWORD=1234
SERVER_PORT=22

[project]
PROJECT_PATH=/path/project

[server-commands]
restart=git pull && sudo systemctl restart my_project
pull=git pull

[local-commands]
push=git add . && git commit -m '$1' && git push
```

In this commands have numbers with $ this char. When you use that you can receive dynamic attributes, strings everything that you can give
Make sure to adjust the values for your specific server and project configuration.
