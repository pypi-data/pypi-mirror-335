    Search for an MP configuration for a given graph. Given a search_method method (by default, it's linear
    programming), we use the sensitivity_evaluator object that provides a function to compute an
    evaluation for the expected sensitivity for a bit-width configuration.
    Then, and after computing the resource utilization for each node in the graph for each bit-width in the search space,
    we search for the optimal solution, given some target_resource_utilization, the solution should fit.
    target_resource_utilization have to be passed. If it was not passed, the facade is not supposed to get here by now.

    Args:
        graph_to_search_cfg: Graph to search a MP configuration for.
        fw_info: FrameworkInfo object about the specific framework (e.g., attributes of different layers' weights to quantize).
        fw_impl: FrameworkImplementation object with specific framework methods implementation.
        target_resource_utilization: Target Resource Utilization to bound our feasible solution space s.t the configuration does not violate it.
        mp_config: Mixed-precision quantization configuration.
        representative_data_gen: Dataset to use for retrieving images for the models inputs.
        search_method: BitWidthSearchMethod to define which searching method to use.
        hessian_info_service: HessianInfoService to fetch Hessian-approximation information.

    Returns:
        A MP configuration for the graph (list of integers, where the index in the list, is the node's
        index in the graph, when the graph is topology sorted, and the value in this index is the
        bit-width index on the node).
