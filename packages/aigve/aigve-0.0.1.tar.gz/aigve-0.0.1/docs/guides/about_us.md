# About us

{{toolkit}} is a website hosting the documentations, tutorials, examples and the latest updates about the `AIGVE` library.

## üöÄ What is `AIGVE`?

`AIGVE` (**AI Generated Video Evaluation Toolkit**) provides a **comprehensive** and **structured** evaluation framework for assessing AI-generated video quality developed by the [IFM Lab](https://www.ifmlab.org/). It integrates multiple evaluation metrics, covering diverse aspects of video evaluation, including neural-network-based assessment, distribution comparison, vision-language alignment, and multi-faceted analysis.

## Library Organization


### üìä **Distribution Comparison-Based Evaluation Metrics**
These metrics assess the quality of generated videos by comparing the distribution of real and generated samples.

- ‚úÖ **[FID](../documentations/metrics/fid.md)**: Frechet Inception Distance (FID) quantifies the similarity between real and generated video feature distributions by measuring the Wasserstein-2 distance.
- ‚úÖ **[FVD](../documentations/metrics/fvd.md)**: Frechet Video Distance (FVD) extends the FID approach to video domain by leveraging spatio-temporal features extracted from action recognition networks.
- ‚úÖ **[IS](../documentations/metrics/is_score.md)**: Inception Score (IS) evaluates both the quality and diversity of generated content by analyzing conditional label distributions.

### üß† **Video-only Neural Network-Based Evaluation Metrics**
These metrics leverage deep learning models to assess AI-generated video quality based on learned representations.

- ‚úÖ **[GSTVQA](../documentations/metrics/gstvqa.md)**: Generalized Spatio-Temporal VQA (GSTVQA) employs graph-based spatio-temporal analysis to assess video quality.
- ‚úÖ **[SimpleVQA](../documentations/metrics/simplevqa.md)**: Simple Video Quality Assessment (Simple-VQA) utilizes deep learning features for no-reference video quality assessment.
- ‚úÖ **[LightVQA+](../documentations/metrics/lightvqaplus.md)**: Light Video Quality Assessment Plus (Light-VQA+) incorporates exposure quality guidance to evaluate video quality.

### üîç **Vision-Language Similarity-Based Evaluation Metrics**
These metrics evaluate **alignment, similarity, and coherence** between visual and textual representations, often using embeddings from models like CLIP and BLIP.

- ‚úÖ **[CLIPSim](../documentations/metrics/clipsim.md)**: CLIP Similarity (CLIPSim) leverages CLIP embeddings to measure semantic similarity between videos and text.
- ‚úÖ **[CLIPTemp](../documentations/metrics/cliptemp.md)**: CLIP Temporal (CLIPTemp) extends CLIPSim by incorporating temporal consistency assessment.
- ‚úÖ **[BLIPSim](../documentations/metrics/blipsim.md)**: Bootstrapped Language-Image Pre-training Similarity (BLIPSim) uses advanced pre-training techniques to improve video-text alignment evaluation.
- ‚úÖ **[Pickscore](../documentations/metrics/pickscore.md)**: PickScore incorporates human preference data to provide more perceptually aligned measurement of video-text matching.

---

### üß† **Vision-Language Understanding-Based Evaluation Metrics**
These metrics assess **higher-level understanding, reasoning, and factual consistency** in vision-language models.

- ‚úÖ **[VIEScore](../documentations/metrics/viescore.md)**: Video Information Evaluation Score (VIEScore) provides explainable assessments of conditional image synthesis.
- ‚úÖ **[TIFA](../documentations/metrics/tifa.md)**: Text-Image Faithfulness Assessment (TIFA) employs question-answering techniques to evaluate text-to-image alignment.
- ‚úÖ **[DSG](../documentations/metrics/dsg.md)**: Davidsonian Scene Graph (DSG) improves fine-grained evaluation reliability through advanced scene graph representations.

---

### üîÑ **Multi-Faceted Evaluation Metrics**
These metrics integrate **structured, multi-dimensional assessments** to provide a **holistic benchmarking framework** for AI-generated videos.

- ‚úÖ **[VideoPhy](../documentations/metrics/videophy.md)**: Video Physics Evaluation (VideoPhy) specifically assesses the physical plausibility of generated videos.
- ‚úÖ **[VideoScore](../documentations/metrics/viescore.md)**: Video Score (VideoScore) simulates fine-grained human feedback across multiple evaluation dimensions.
