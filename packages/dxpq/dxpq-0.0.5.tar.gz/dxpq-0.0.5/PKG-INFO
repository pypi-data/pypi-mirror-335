## Overview


**dxpq** is a simple and intuitive Python library designed to facilitate connection and interaction with PostgreSQL databases. It was created with the goal of providing an efficient way to perform common PostgreSQL operations, such as executing SQL queries, inserting and updating data, and managing transactions.

This library is lightweight and easy to use, allowing developers to quickly connect to the database without the complexity of setting up additional packages. With support for basic SQL commands and transactions, **dxpq** offers a clear and straightforward interface for working with PostgreSQL.

Ideal for those seeking a minimalist solution focused only on essential database operations, **dxpq** is perfect for projects that don't require large frameworks or heavy libraries but still need robust communication with PostgreSQL.


---

## Features

- **Database Connection**: Easily establish a connection to a PostgreSQL database using a connection string.

- **Cursor Management**: Create and manage cursors for executing SQL queries. Fetch all results or a single row, with support for different result formats (e.g., dictionary-style results).

- **SQL Execution**: Execute SQL queries and commands with parameters for secure and dynamic query building.

- **Context Manager Support**: The library supports context manager functionality, allowing the use of connections and cursors in `with` blocks for automatic resource management.

- **Cursor Types**: Supports different cursor types, such as dictionary-style results, for easier access to columns by name.

- **Clean Resource Management**: Automatically close database connections and cursors when done, either through context management or explicit cleanup with `close()` and `__del__` methods.
