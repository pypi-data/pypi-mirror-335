# Linear MCP

A Linear API integration for MCP.

## Quickstart

### 1. Get Linear API Key

Obtain a Linear API Key from your Linear Account: https://linear.app/YOUR-ORG-NAME-HERE/settings/account/security

### 2. Install `pipx`

```bash
# MacOS
brew install pipx

# Linux
apt install pipx

# (All environments) Set up PATH
pipx ensurepath
```

### Cursor

Create a `command` MCP server with the following command:

```bash
pipx run linear-mcp --linear-api-key ... --team_name ...
```

### Windsurf

In Windsurf settings, add a Custom MCP server with configuration like the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "command": "pipx",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "linear-mcp",
        "--linear-api-key",
        "...",
        "--team_name",
        "..."
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

### Using Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t linear-mcp .

# Run the container
docker run -it --rm -e LINEAR_API_KEY=... linear-mcp LINEAR_TEAM_NAME=...
```

### Using pipx

To build the pipx package locally, run:

```bash
pipx install -e . --force
```

### Using Virtual Environments


1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install build dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-build.txt
```

3. Install development dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

4. Install the package in development mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Releases

This repository is published to PyPI using GitHub Actions. 

This happens automatically when you push to the `main` branch.

If you do not bump the verison in `pyproject.toml`, the release will fail.

Prior to merging to main, it is also a good idea to install the package globally on your local machine:

```bash
pipx install -e . --force
```

... and then use the mcp inspector to test all the resources, tools, etc.:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector linear-mcp --linear-api-key ... --team_name ...
```

Because a `transport stdio` cannot write to standard out, there is file based logging.
By default, the server writes to `linear_api.log`, whose location varies depending on how the server was installed / started.
