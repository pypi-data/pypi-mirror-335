## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. Please be respectful, inclusive, and considerate when interacting with other contributors.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**:

   - Visit the [Recursivist repository](https://github.com/ArmaanjeetSandhu/recursivist) and click the "Fork" button to create your own copy.

2. **Clone your fork**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArmaanjeetSandhu/recursivist.git
   cd recursivist
   ```

3. **Set up the upstream remote**:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ArmaanjeetSandhu/recursivist.git
   ```

4. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Creating a Branch

1. **Make sure your fork is up to date**:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

### Making Changes

1. **Make your changes** to the codebase according to our [coding standards](#coding-standards).

2. **Commit your changes** with clear and descriptive commit messages:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of what you added"
   ```

3. **Keep your branch updated** with the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git pull upstream main
   ```

### Testing Your Changes

1. **Run the tests** to make sure your changes don't break existing functionality:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

2. **Test the CLI** to verify it works as expected:
   ```bash
   python -m recursivist --help
   ```

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Push your branch** to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** from your fork to the main repository:

   - Go to the [Recursivist repository](https://github.com/ArmaanjeetSandhu/recursivist)
   - Click "Pull Requests" > "New Pull Request"
   - Select "compare across forks" and choose your fork and branch
   - Click "Create Pull Request"

3. **Describe your changes** in the PR:

   - What problem does it solve?
   - How can it be tested?
   - Any dependencies or breaking changes?

4. **Address review feedback** if requested by maintainers.

## Coding Standards

### Code Style

We follow PEP 8 and use the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting:

  ```bash
  pip install black
  black recursivist/
  ```

- **Flake8** for linting:

  ```bash
  pip install flake8
  flake8 recursivist/
  ```

- **isort** for import sorting:

  ```bash
  pip install isort
  isort recursivist/
  ```

- **mypy** for type checking:

  ```bash
  pip install mypy
  mypy recursivist/
  ```

### Documentation

- Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.
- Follow the Google docstring style as shown in existing code.

Example docstring:

```python
def function(arg1: str, arg2: int) -> bool:
    """A short description of the function.

    A more detailed description explaining the behavior, edge cases, and implementation details if relevant.

    Args:
        arg1: Description of the first argument
        arg2: Description of the second argument

    Returns:
        Description of the return value

    Raises:
        ValueError: When the input is invalid
    """
```

### Type Annotations

We use Python type hints for better code quality and IDE support:

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Set

def process_data(data: Dict[str, List[str]],
                 options: Optional[Set[str]] = None) -> bool:
    # Function implementation
    return True
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

We use pytest for testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=recursivist

# Run tests from a specific file
pytest tests/test_core.py
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Place tests in the `tests/` directory with a name that matches the module being tested.
- Follow the test style used in existing tests.

Example test:

```python
# tests/test_core.py
from recursivist.core import generate_color_for_extension

def test_generate_color_for_extension():
    # Given
    extension = ".py"

    # When
    color = generate_color_for_extension(extension)

    # Then
    assert isinstance(color, str)
    assert color.startswith("#")
    assert len(color) == 7
```

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests
