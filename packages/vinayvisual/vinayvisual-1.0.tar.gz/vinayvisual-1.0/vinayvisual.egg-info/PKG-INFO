This is build to solve visual based problem that are not available in opencv , scipy  and numpy as it provide background support of theories and calculation to solve problem like -
1.image segmentation based on colour(from vinayvisual import image_segmentation)
2.video segmentation based on colour(from vinayvisual import video_segmentation)
3.similarates the two contour based on calculation(from vinayvisual import contour_similarates)
4.measure relative rotation between two contours(from vinayvisual import angle_turn_segment)
5.feature tracking via contour tracking(from vinayvisual import contourfeature_tracking)
6.measure 3d rotation using contour tracking for solid having minimum 1 flate surface or greater then it(from vinayvisual import rotation3d)
7.orientation of object using contour tracking(from vinayvisual import orientation3d)
