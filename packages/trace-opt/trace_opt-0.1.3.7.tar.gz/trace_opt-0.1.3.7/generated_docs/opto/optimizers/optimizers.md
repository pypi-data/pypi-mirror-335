## ClassDef AbstractOptimizer
**AbstractOptimizer**: The function of AbstractOptimizer is to serve as a base class for optimizers, responsible for updating parameters based on feedback.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· parameters: A list of ParameterNode objects that the optimizer will manage and update.

**Code Description**: The AbstractOptimizer class is designed to be a foundational class for creating various optimizers. It ensures that any derived optimizer class will have a consistent interface and behavior for managing and updating parameters.

- The `__init__` method initializes the optimizer with a list of ParameterNode objects. It asserts that the provided parameters are indeed a list and that each element in the list is an instance of ParameterNode. This ensures type safety and consistency in the parameters being managed.

- The `step` method is an abstract method intended to be overridden by subclasses. It is supposed to contain the logic for updating the parameters based on feedback. Since it is not implemented in AbstractOptimizer, any subclass must provide an implementation for this method.

- The `zero_feedback` method is another abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. It is intended to reset the feedback for all parameters, preparing them for the next optimization step.

- The `propagator` property is designed to return a Propagator object, which can be used to propagate feedback backward through the network. This property must also be implemented by any subclass.

The AbstractOptimizer class is called by the Optimizer class, which extends its functionality. The Optimizer class provides concrete implementations for the abstract methods defined in AbstractOptimizer. For instance, it implements the `step` method to propose new parameter values based on feedback and then update the parameters accordingly. It also provides a `zero_feedback` method to reset feedback for all parameters and a `propagator` property to return the appropriate Propagator object.

**Note**: 
- Any subclass of AbstractOptimizer must implement the `step`, `zero_feedback`, and `propagator` methods.
- The parameters passed to the AbstractOptimizer must be a list of ParameterNode instances.
- The class ensures a consistent interface for optimizers, making it easier to extend and create new optimization algorithms.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, parameters)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the AbstractOptimizer class with a list of ParameterNode objects.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameters: A list of ParameterNode objects that represent the parameters to be optimized.
· *args: Additional positional arguments.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method of the AbstractOptimizer class is responsible for initializing the optimizer with a set of parameters. It takes a list of ParameterNode objects as its primary argument. The method first asserts that the provided parameters argument is indeed a list. It then checks that every element in this list is an instance of the ParameterNode class. If these conditions are met, the parameters are assigned to the instance variable self.parameters.

The ParameterNode class, which is used in this context, represents a trainable node in a computational graph. It is initialized with various attributes such as value, name, trainable status, description, constraint, and additional info. The ParameterNode class inherits from a generic Node class and adds itself to a set of dependencies upon initialization.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the parameters argument passed to the __init__ method is a list of ParameterNode objects.
- The method uses assertions to enforce type checking, which will raise an AssertionError if the conditions are not met.
- Additional positional and keyword arguments (*args and **kwargs) are accepted but not utilized within this method.

### FunctionDef step(self)
**step**: The function of step is to update the parameters based on the feedback.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The step function is designed to update the parameters of an optimizer based on feedback. However, in its current form, it is an abstract method, meaning it is intended to be overridden by subclasses of the AbstractOptimizer class. The method raises a NotImplementedError, which indicates that any subclass must provide its own implementation of the step method. This design enforces that the specific logic for updating parameters must be defined in the subclasses, ensuring that the AbstractOptimizer class remains flexible and adaptable to various optimization strategies.

**Note**: 
- This method must be implemented in any subclass of AbstractOptimizer.
- Attempting to call this method directly from an instance of AbstractOptimizer will result in a NotImplementedError.
- Ensure that the subclass provides a concrete implementation of the step method to perform the actual parameter update logic.
***
### FunctionDef zero_feedback(self)
**zero_feedback**: The function of zero_feedback is to reset the feedback.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The zero_feedback function is designed to reset the feedback mechanism within an optimizer. However, the function is currently not implemented and raises a NotImplementedError when called. This indicates that any subclass inheriting from the class containing this function must provide its own implementation of the zero_feedback method. The purpose of this function is to ensure that subclasses define how the feedback should be reset, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the optimizer.

**Note**: When using this function, it is important to implement the zero_feedback method in any subclass that inherits from the parent class. Failure to do so will result in a NotImplementedError being raised, which will halt the execution of the program. This function serves as a placeholder to enforce the implementation of feedback resetting logic in derived classes.
***

**propagator**: The function of propagator is to return a Propagator object that can be used to propagate feedback in backward.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The propagator function is designed to return a Propagator object, which is intended to be used for propagating feedback in a backward pass. However, the current implementation of this function raises a NotImplementedError. This indicates that the function is meant to be overridden in a subclass, where the actual logic for returning a Propagator object should be provided. The NotImplementedError serves as a placeholder to remind developers that they need to implement this method in any concrete subclass derived from the abstract class.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that it is properly overridden in any subclass. Attempting to call this method directly from the abstract class without overriding it will result in a NotImplementedError.
***
## ClassDef Optimizer
**Optimizer**: The function of Optimizer is to serve as a base class for optimizers, responsible for updating parameters based on feedback.

**attributes**:
- parameters: A list of ParameterNode objects that the optimizer will manage and update.

**Code Description**:
The Optimizer class is a base class for creating various optimizers. It provides a consistent interface and behavior for managing and updating parameters based on feedback. The class extends the AbstractOptimizer class and implements the abstract methods defined in it.

The `__init__` method initializes the optimizer with a list of ParameterNode objects. It ensures that the provided parameters are a list and that each element in the list is an instance of ParameterNode. This ensures type safety and consistency in the parameters being managed. The method also sets the propagator attribute to the default propagator returned by the default_propagator method.

The `propagator` property returns the propagator object associated with the optimizer.

The `step` method is responsible for proposing new parameter values based on feedback and updating the parameters accordingly. It calls the `propose` method to get the proposed update dictionary and then calls the `update` method to update the trainable parameters with the new data.

The `propose` method is a helper method that calls the `_step` method to get the new data of the parameters based on the feedback.

The `update` method updates the trainable parameters with the new data provided in the update dictionary. It iterates over the items in the update dictionary and updates the data of each trainable parameter if it is marked as trainable.

The `zero_feedback` method resets the feedback for all parameters by calling the `zero_feedback` method of each parameter.

The `_step` method is an abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. It returns the new data of parameter nodes based on the feedback. Subclasses should provide their own implementation of this method.

The `default_propagator` method is an abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. It returns the default Propagator object of the optimizer. Subclasses should provide their own implementation of this method.

The `backward` method propagates the feedback backward by calling the `backward` method of the given node with the propagator object.

**Note**:
- Any subclass of Optimizer must implement the `_step`, `default_propagator`, and `backward` methods.
- The parameters passed to the Optimizer must be a list of ParameterNode instances.
- The class ensures a consistent interface for optimizers, making it easier to extend and create new optimization algorithms.

**Output Example**:
```python
{
    'parameter1': value1,
    'parameter2': value2,
    ...
}
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, parameters)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the Optimizer class with specified parameters and an optional propagator.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameters: A list of ParameterNode objects that represent the parameters to be optimized.
· *args: Additional positional arguments.
· propagator: An optional Propagator object. If not provided, a default Propagator will be used.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method initializes an Optimizer instance. It first calls the superclass's __init__ method with the provided parameters. Then, it checks if a propagator is provided. If not, it calls the default_propagator method to obtain a default Propagator. The method ensures that the propagator is an instance of the Propagator class. Finally, it assigns the propagator to the instance's _propagator attribute. This setup ensures that the Optimizer always has a valid Propagator, either provided explicitly or obtained through the default_propagator method.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the parameters argument is a list of ParameterNode objects and that the propagator, if provided, is an instance of the Propagator class. If no propagator is provided, the default_propagator method must be properly implemented in a subclass to avoid a NotImplementedError.
***
### FunctionDef propagator(self)
**propagator**: The function of propagator is to return the internal `_propagator` attribute of the class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The `propagator` function is a simple accessor method that returns the value of the `_propagator` attribute from the class instance. This method does not take any parameters and directly provides access to the internal `_propagator` attribute, which is presumably an instance of a propagator object used within the class.

The `propagator` function is utilized in several other methods within the project. For instance, in the `summarize` method of the `FunctionOptimizer` class, it is used to aggregate feedback from all trainable parameters. The `propagator` is called to perform the aggregation of feedbacks, which are then summed up to create a summary.

In the `_step` method of the `FunctionOptimizer` class, the `propagator` is asserted to be an instance of `GraphPropagator` before summarizing the feedback and constructing prompts for further processing.

Additionally, in the `backward` method of the `Optimizer` class, the `propagator` is passed as an argument to the `backward` method of a node, facilitating the backward propagation of feedback.

**Note**: This function is a straightforward accessor and does not perform any additional logic or validation. It is essential that the `_propagator` attribute is correctly initialized within the class for this method to function as expected.

**Output Example**: The return value of the `propagator` function would be the internal `_propagator` object, which could be an instance of a class responsible for propagating information or feedback within the optimization process. For example:
```
<GraphPropagator object at 0x7f8b9c0d1d30>
```
***
### FunctionDef step(self)
**step**: The function of step is to execute a single optimization step by proposing new parameter data and updating the parameters accordingly.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· *args: Variable length argument list.
· **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments.

**Code Description**: The step function is a method within the Optimizer class that orchestrates the process of updating the trainable parameters. It performs this task in two main stages:

1. **Propose New Data**: The function first calls the propose method, passing along any positional and keyword arguments it receives. The propose method generates a dictionary (update_dict) containing new data for the parameters. This dictionary is created based on feedback and is essential for the subsequent update process.

2. **Update Parameters**: After obtaining the update_dict from the propose method, the step function calls the update method. The update method takes the update_dict as input and iterates over its key-value pairs. For each pair, it checks if the parameter node (key) is marked as trainable. If the node is trainable, it updates the node's internal data (_data) with the new data provided in the dictionary.

The step function is integral to the optimization process, as it ensures that the parameters are updated based on the latest feedback. It relies on the propose method to generate the necessary updates and the update method to apply these updates to the parameters.

**Note**:
- The propose method must be correctly implemented to generate a valid update_dict.
- The update method will only modify the parameters that are marked as trainable.
- The step function is designed to be flexible, accepting any number of positional and keyword arguments, which are passed through to the propose method.
***
### FunctionDef propose(self)
**propose**: The function of propose is to propose the new data of the parameters based on the feedback.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· *args: Variable length argument list.
· **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments.

**Code Description**: The propose function is a method within the Optimizer class designed to generate new parameter data based on feedback. It serves as a public interface for proposing updates to the parameters. The function accepts any number of positional and keyword arguments, which are then passed directly to the _step method.

The propose method internally calls the _step method, which is responsible for the actual computation of the new parameter data. The _step method is abstract and must be implemented by any subclass of the Optimizer class. This design allows for different optimization strategies to be implemented by overriding the _step method in subclasses.

The propose method is also called by the step method within the same class. The step method uses propose to generate the update dictionary, which is then applied to update the parameters.

**Note**: 
- The _step method must be implemented in any subclass of the Optimizer class; otherwise, a NotImplementedError will be raised.
- The propose method relies on the _step method to perform the actual parameter updates, making it essential to provide a correct and efficient implementation of _step in subclasses.
- The function is designed to be flexible, accepting any number of positional and keyword arguments.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a dictionary where keys are instances of ParameterNode and values can be of any type, representing the new data for each parameter node.
***
### FunctionDef update(self, update_dict)
**update**: The function of update is to update the trainable parameters given a dictionary of new data.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· update_dict: A dictionary where keys are instances of ParameterNode and values are the new data to update the parameters with.

**Code Description**: The update function is designed to modify the trainable parameters of an optimizer. It takes a dictionary, update_dict, as input. The keys of this dictionary are instances of ParameterNode, and the values are the new data to be assigned to these nodes.

The function iterates over each key-value pair in the update_dict. For each pair, it checks if the ParameterNode (key) is marked as trainable. If the node is trainable, it updates the node's internal data (_data) with the new data provided in the dictionary.

This function is called by the step function within the same Optimizer class. The step function first generates an update_dict by calling the propose method and then passes this dictionary to the update function to apply the updates.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the keys in the update_dict are instances of ParameterNode.
- Only the nodes marked as trainable will be updated.
- This function directly modifies the internal state (_data) of the ParameterNode instances.
***
### FunctionDef zero_feedback(self)
**zero_feedback**: The function of zero_feedback is to reset the feedback values of all parameters managed by the optimizer to zero.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The zero_feedback function iterates over all the parameters contained within the optimizer instance and calls the zero_feedback method on each parameter. This effectively resets any feedback-related values or states associated with the parameters to zero. This function is crucial in scenarios where feedback mechanisms are used to adjust parameters during optimization, and there is a need to reset these adjustments, possibly at the beginning of a new optimization cycle or after a certain number of iterations.

The function is called within the context of unit tests located in tests\unit_tests\test_optimizer.py, indicating its importance in ensuring that the feedback resetting mechanism works correctly. This is essential for maintaining the integrity and expected behavior of the optimizer during its operation.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that each parameter object within the optimizer has a zero_feedback method implemented; otherwise, this function will raise an AttributeError.
- This function should be used when there is a need to clear feedback states, typically before starting a new optimization phase or after specific intervals to maintain the stability and performance of the optimization process.
***
### FunctionDef _step(self)
**_step**: The function of _step is to return the new data of parameter nodes based on the feedback.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· *args: Variable length argument list.
· **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments.

**Code Description**: The _step function is designed to be a core method within an optimizer class, responsible for updating the data of parameter nodes based on feedback. This function is abstract and raises a NotImplementedError, indicating that any subclass must provide an implementation for this method. The return type of the function is a dictionary where keys are instances of ParameterNode and values can be of any type.

The _step function is called by the propose method within the same class. The propose method serves as a public interface to generate new parameter data based on feedback, and it delegates the actual computation to the _step method. This design allows for flexibility and extensibility, as different optimization strategies can be implemented by overriding the _step method in subclasses.

The ParameterNode class, which is referenced in the return type, represents a trainable node in a computational graph. It inherits from a generic Node class and includes additional attributes such as name, trainable status, description, constraint, and info. The ParameterNode class also maintains a set of dependencies, specifically adding itself to a 'parameter' dependency set.

**Note**: 
- The _step function must be implemented in any subclass of the optimizer class; otherwise, a NotImplementedError will be raised.
- The function is designed to be flexible, accepting any number of positional and keyword arguments.
- The propose method relies on _step to perform the actual parameter updates, making it essential to provide a correct and efficient implementation of _step in subclasses.
***
### FunctionDef default_propagator(self)
**default_propagator**: The function of default_propagator is to return the default Propagator object of the optimizer.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The default_propagator function is designed to return the default Propagator object associated with the optimizer. However, in its current implementation, it raises a NotImplementedError. This indicates that the function is intended to be overridden in a subclass, where the actual logic for returning a default Propagator will be provided. The function is called within the __init__ method of the Optimizer class. During the initialization of an Optimizer object, if no Propagator is explicitly provided, the default_propagator function is invoked to obtain a default Propagator. The returned Propagator is then assigned to the _propagator attribute of the Optimizer instance. This ensures that the Optimizer always has a valid Propagator, either provided explicitly or obtained through the default_propagator method.

**Note**: When implementing a subclass of the Optimizer, it is essential to override the default_propagator method to provide a concrete implementation that returns a valid Propagator object. Failure to do so will result in a NotImplementedError being raised during the initialization of the Optimizer if no Propagator is provided.
***
### FunctionDef backward(self, node)
**backward**: The function of backward is to perform a backward pass in the optimization process. It propagates feedback from a node to its parents by calling the propagator function and updating the feedback values. 

**parameters**:
- node: The node from which the feedback is propagated.
- *args: Additional positional arguments that can be passed to the node's backward method.
- **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to the node's backward method.

**Code Description**: The backward function is responsible for propagating feedback from a node to its parents in the optimization process. It first checks if a propagator function is provided, and if not, it imports the GraphPropagator class from the opto.trace.propagators.graph_propagator module. 

The function then adds the feedback from the node to a feedback dictionary using the _add_feedback method of the node. The feedback is obtained by calling the propagator function with the node as an argument. The feedback dictionary is used to store the feedback from each child node, where each key is a child node and the value is a list of feedbacks from that child.

After adding the feedback, the function iterates over the parents of the node and propagates the feedback to each parent. If a parent is present in the propagated feedback dictionary, the feedback is added to the parent using the _add_feedback method. 

The function also supports visualization of the propagation process by creating a graph using the graphviz library. The graph is created in reverse order if the reverse_plot parameter is set to True. 

Finally, the function sets the _backwarded attribute of the node to True, indicating that the backward pass has been performed. The value of the retain_graph parameter determines whether the feedback should be retained or zeroed out after propagation.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the propagator function is correctly initialized before calling the backward function. The function relies on the propagator to perform the feedback propagation. If the propagator is not provided or initialized correctly, the backward pass may not function as expected.

**Output Example**: The backward function returns a graph (digraph) object if the visualize parameter is set to True. Otherwise, it returns None.
