## ClassDef FIFOBuffer
**FIFOBuffer**: The function of FIFOBuffer is to manage a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffer of a specified size.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· size: The maximum number of items the buffer can hold.
· buffer: A list that stores the items in the buffer.

**Code Description**: The FIFOBuffer class is designed to handle a buffer that operates on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis. This means that the first item added to the buffer will be the first one to be removed when the buffer reaches its maximum size.

- The `__init__` method initializes the buffer with a specified size and creates an empty list to store the items.
- The `add` method allows adding an item to the buffer. If the buffer exceeds the specified size, it removes the oldest items to maintain the size constraint.
- The `__iter__` method returns an iterator for the buffer, allowing it to be used in loops and other iterable contexts.
- The `__len__` method returns the current number of items in the buffer.

In the project, the FIFOBuffer is utilized by the `FunctionOptimizerV2Memory` class in the `opto\optimizers\function_optimizer.py` file. Specifically, it is instantiated in the `__init__` method of `FunctionOptimizerV2Memory` with a parameter `memory_size`, which determines the size of the FIFO buffer. This integration suggests that the FIFOBuffer is used to store a limited history of optimization states or results, ensuring that only the most recent entries are kept.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the size parameter is a positive integer to avoid unexpected behavior.
- The buffer will automatically discard the oldest items when new items are added beyond its capacity.

**Output Example**: 
If a FIFOBuffer is created with a size of 3 and the following items are added in sequence: `1, 2, 3, 4`, the buffer will contain `[2, 3, 4]`. The first item `1` is discarded to maintain the buffer size of 3.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, size)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a FIFOBuffer object with a specified size.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· size: An integer representing the maximum size of the buffer.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor method for the FIFOBuffer class. It takes one parameter, size, which determines the maximum number of elements that the buffer can hold. Inside the function, the size parameter is assigned to the instance variable self.size. Additionally, an empty list is initialized and assigned to the instance variable self.buffer. This list will be used to store the elements of the buffer.

**Note**: 
- The size parameter must be a positive integer.
- The buffer is initially empty upon creation of the FIFOBuffer object.

### FunctionDef add(self, item)
**add**: The function of add is to insert a new item into the buffer while maintaining its maximum size.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· item: The item to be added to the buffer.

**Code Description**: The add function is a method of the FIFOBuffer class, which is designed to manage a buffer with a fixed maximum size. When a new item is added to the buffer, the function first checks if the buffer size is greater than zero. If it is, the item is appended to the buffer. After appending the item, the buffer is truncated to ensure that its size does not exceed the predefined maximum size. This is achieved by slicing the buffer to keep only the most recent items up to the specified size.

In the context of its usage within the project, the add function is called by the construct_prompt method of the FunctionOptimizerV2Memory class. Specifically, after constructing the system and user prompts, the add function is used to store a tuple containing the summary variables and user feedback into the memory buffer. This ensures that the memory buffer maintains a record of past interactions, which can be used to provide examples in future prompts.

**Note**: 
- The buffer size must be set to a positive integer for the add function to operate correctly.
- The function ensures that the buffer does not grow beyond its maximum size, maintaining only the most recent items.
- Proper handling of the buffer size is crucial to avoid unexpected behavior.

### FunctionDef __iter__(self)
**__iter__**: The function of __iter__ is to return an iterator for the buffer attribute of the FIFOBuffer instance.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The __iter__ function is a special method in Python that allows an object to be iterable. In this implementation, the __iter__ method returns an iterator for the buffer attribute of the FIFOBuffer instance. The buffer attribute is expected to be a collection (such as a list) that supports iteration. By calling iter(self.buffer), the method leverages Python's built-in iter function to obtain an iterator for the buffer, enabling the FIFOBuffer instance to be used in contexts that require iteration, such as in for-loops.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the buffer attribute is properly initialized and contains iterable elements before invoking the __iter__ method.
- This method does not modify the buffer; it only provides a way to iterate over its elements.

**Output Example**: 
If the buffer attribute of the FIFOBuffer instance contains the elements [1, 2, 3], calling the __iter__ method will return an iterator that produces the sequence 1, 2, 3 when iterated over.
***
### FunctionDef __len__(self)
**__len__**: The function of __len__ is to return the number of elements currently stored in the buffer.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The __len__ function is a special method in Python that is used to define the behavior of the len() function for instances of a class. In this context, the __len__ function returns the length of the buffer attribute of the FIFOBuffer class. The buffer attribute is expected to be a list or another collection that supports the len() function. When len() is called on an instance of FIFOBuffer, it internally calls this __len__ method, which in turn returns the length of the buffer.

**Note**: Ensure that the buffer attribute is properly initialized and maintained as a collection that supports the len() function. If the buffer is not initialized or is set to a non-collection type, calling len() on an instance of FIFOBuffer will result in an error.

**Output Example**: If the buffer contains 5 elements, calling len() on an instance of FIFOBuffer will return 5.
