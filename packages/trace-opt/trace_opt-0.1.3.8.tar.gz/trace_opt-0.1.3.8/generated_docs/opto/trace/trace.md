## ClassDef stop_tracing
**stop_tracing**: The function of stop_tracing is to disable tracing within a specific context.

**attributes**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The `stop_tracing` class is a context manager that is used to disable tracing within a specific context. When the `stop_tracing` object is entered, it sets the `GRAPH.TRACE` attribute to `False`, effectively disabling tracing. When the context is exited, the `GRAPH.TRACE` attribute is set back to `True`, enabling tracing again.

This class is typically used in conjunction with the `trace` module to control the tracing behavior of a program. Tracing is a technique used to monitor the execution of a program by recording information about each executed statement. By disabling tracing within a specific context, developers can exclude certain parts of the code from being traced, which can be useful for performance optimization or debugging purposes.

In the project, the `stop_tracing` class is called in the `test_bundle.py` file within the `run` function. It is used to disable tracing while executing certain code blocks. This allows developers to selectively trace or exclude specific parts of the code during testing.

**Note**:
- The `stop_tracing` class is a context manager, so it should be used within a `with` statement to ensure proper entry and exit.
- Disabling tracing can be useful for performance optimization or debugging purposes, but it should be used with caution as it may affect the accuracy of the tracing results.
### FunctionDef __enter__(self)
**__enter__**: The function of __enter__ is to set the tracing state to False.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 self: Refers to the instance of the class that contains this method.

**Code Description**: The __enter__ method is a special method used in the context management protocol in Python. When an instance of the class containing this method is used in a `with` statement, the __enter__ method is automatically invoked at the beginning of the block. In this specific implementation, the __enter__ method sets the `TRACE` attribute of the `GRAPH` object to `False`. This action effectively stops or disables tracing within the context of the `with` statement. The `GRAPH` object is assumed to be a global or otherwise accessible object that controls tracing functionality.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `GRAPH` object and its `TRACE` attribute are properly defined and accessible within the scope where this method is used.
- This method is typically used in conjunction with the `__exit__` method to manage resources or states within a `with` statement.
***
### FunctionDef __exit__(self, type, value, traceback)
**__exit__**: The function of __exit__ is to reset the tracing state by setting `GRAPH.TRACE` to `True`.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 type: The exception type, if any exception was raised.
路 value: The exception instance, if any exception was raised.
路 traceback: The traceback object, if any exception was raised.

**Code Description**: The `__exit__` method is a special method used in context management in Python. It is called when the execution of a block inside a `with` statement is finished. In this specific implementation, the `__exit__` method sets the `TRACE` attribute of the `GRAPH` object to `True`. This indicates that tracing should be enabled or resumed after the context block is exited, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. The method takes three parameters: `type`, `value`, and `traceback`, which are standard for the `__exit__` method and provide information about any exception that may have occurred within the `with` block.

**Note**: 
- This method is part of the context management protocol and is automatically invoked at the end of a `with` statement.
- The parameters `type`, `value`, and `traceback` are necessary for handling exceptions, but in this implementation, they are not used.
- Ensure that `GRAPH` and its `TRACE` attribute are properly defined and accessible within the scope where this `__exit__` method is used.
