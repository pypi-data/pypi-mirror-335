## ClassDef AbstractPropagator
**AbstractPropagator**: The function of AbstractPropagator is to serve as a base class for propagating feedback from a child node to its parent nodes in a hierarchical structure.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· This class does not define any attributes directly.

**Code Description**: The AbstractPropagator class is designed to facilitate the propagation of feedback from a child node to its parent nodes. It provides a structured way to ensure that feedback is correctly propagated and formatted.

- The `__call__` method is the primary interface for propagating feedback. When this method is called with a `MessageNode` instance as the `child` parameter, it performs several checks and operations:
  - It asserts that the `child` is an instance of `MessageNode`.
  - It ensures that all feedback values in the `child` node have a length of at most 1.
  - It calls the `propagate` method to compute the propagated feedback.
  - It verifies that the propagated feedback is a dictionary where the keys are the parent nodes and the values are the feedback.
  - Finally, it returns the propagated feedback.

- The `propagate` method is an abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. It is responsible for computing the propagated feedback to the parent nodes of the given `child` node. The method should return a dictionary where the keys are the parent nodes and the values are the propagated feedback. Since this method is not implemented in the AbstractPropagator class, it raises a `NotImplementedError`.

The AbstractPropagator class is extended by the `Propagator` class, which provides specific implementations for the `propagate` method and additional functionalities such as registering custom propagation functions and initializing feedback.

**Note**: 
- The `propagate` method must be implemented in any subclass of AbstractPropagator.
- The `__call__` method ensures that the feedback is correctly formatted and propagated, making it a critical part of the feedback propagation process.

**Output Example**: 
Given a properly implemented subclass of AbstractPropagator, the return value of the `__call__` method might look like the following:
```python
{
    parent_node_1: feedback_data_1,
    parent_node_2: feedback_data_2,
    # ... other parent nodes and their respective feedback
}
```
This dictionary maps parent nodes to their respective propagated feedback.
### FunctionDef __call__(self, child)
**__call__**: The function of __call__ is to propagate the feedback from a child node to its parents.
**parameters**:
- child: A MessageNode object representing the child node for which the feedback needs to be propagated.

**Code Description**:
The `__call__` function is a method of the `AbstractPropagator` class defined in the `propagators.py` module. It is responsible for propagating the feedback from a child node to its parents. The function takes a `child` parameter, which is expected to be a `MessageNode` object.

The function first checks if the `child` is an instance of `MessageNode` and if the feedback from the child is of the correct format. The feedback should be a dictionary with the parents of the child as keys and the feedback values as values.

Next, the function calls the `propagate` method of the concrete propagator class that inherits from `AbstractPropagator`. This method is expected to be implemented in the concrete propagator class and should perform the actual propagation of feedback. The `propagate` method returns the propagated feedback as a dictionary.

The function then checks if the propagated feedback has the correct format, ensuring that it is a dictionary and that all the parents of the child are present as keys in the dictionary.

Finally, the function returns the propagated feedback.

**Note**:
- The `__call__` function is expected to be implemented in a concrete propagator class that inherits from `AbstractPropagator`.
- The `__call__` function assumes that the feedback from the child is already computed and stored in the `feedback` attribute of the child node.
- The function raises an error if the child is not an instance of `MessageNode` or if the feedback from the child is not of the correct format.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
{
    parent_node_1: feedback_value_1,
    parent_node_2: feedback_value_2,
    ...
}
```
This example assumes that the propagated feedback is a dictionary with the parent nodes as keys and the corresponding feedback values as values. The actual content of the feedback will depend on the specific implementation and use case within the project.

### FunctionDef propagate(self, child)
**propagate**: The function of propagate is to compute and return the propagated feedback to the parents of a given node. It returns a dictionary where the keys are the parents and the values are the propagated feedback.

**parameters**:
- child: A MessageNode object representing the child node for which the feedback needs to be propagated.

**Code Description**:
The `propagate` function is a method of the `AbstractPropagator` class defined in the `propagators.py` module. It is responsible for propagating the feedback from a child node to its parents. The function takes a `child` parameter, which is expected to be a `MessageNode` object.

The function first checks if the `child` is an instance of `MessageNode` and if the feedback from the child is of the correct format. The feedback should be a dictionary with the parents of the child as keys and the feedback values as values.

Next, the function calls the `propagate` method of the concrete propagator class that inherits from `AbstractPropagator`. This method is expected to be implemented in the concrete propagator class and should perform the actual propagation of feedback. The `propagate` method returns the propagated feedback as a dictionary.

The function then checks if the propagated feedback has the correct format, ensuring that it is a dictionary and that all the parents of the child are present as keys in the dictionary.

Finally, the function returns the propagated feedback.

**Note**:
- The `propagate` function is expected to be implemented in a concrete propagator class that inherits from `AbstractPropagator`.
- The `propagate` function assumes that the feedback from the child is already computed and stored in the `feedback` attribute of the child node.
- The function raises an error if the child is not an instance of `MessageNode` or if the feedback from the child is not of the correct format.
***
## ClassDef AbstractFeedback
**AbstractFeedback**: The function of AbstractFeedback is to serve as a feedback container used by propagators, supporting addition operations.

**attributes**: This class does not define any attributes.

**Code Description**: 
The AbstractFeedback class is designed to act as a base class for feedback containers used by propagators. It defines the necessary interface for feedback objects that need to support addition operations. The class includes two methods:

1. `__add__(self, other)`: This method is intended to handle the addition of two feedback objects. However, it raises a NotImplementedError, indicating that any subclass must implement this method to define the specific addition behavior.

2. `__radd__(self, other)`: This method supports the addition operation when the AbstractFeedback object is on the right-hand side of the addition. It checks if the other operand is zero, which is useful for operations like sum where the initial value is zero. If the other operand is zero, it returns the current object (self). Otherwise, it delegates the addition operation to the `__add__` method.

The AbstractFeedback class is utilized in the TraceGraph class, which inherits from AbstractFeedback. The TraceGraph class provides a concrete implementation of the `__add__` method, ensuring that feedback objects can be combined according to specific rules defined within TraceGraph. This relationship indicates that AbstractFeedback serves as a foundational component for more specialized feedback containers like TraceGraph.

**Note**: 
- Any subclass of AbstractFeedback must implement the `__add__` method to define how feedback objects should be combined.
- The `__radd__` method facilitates the use of AbstractFeedback objects in operations like sum, where the initial value might be zero.

**Output Example**: 
Since AbstractFeedback is an abstract class and does not implement the `__add__` method, it does not produce any direct output. However, a subclass like TraceGraph would produce combined feedback objects when the `__add__` method is called. For example, combining two TraceGraph objects might result in a new TraceGraph object with a merged graph and user feedback.
### FunctionDef __add__(self, other)
**__add__**: The function of __add__ is to define the addition operation for instances of the class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· self: The instance of the class on which the method is called.
· other: The instance or value to be added to the instance represented by self.

**Code Description**: The __add__ method is intended to define the behavior of the addition operation for instances of the class it belongs to. However, in its current implementation, it raises a NotImplementedError, indicating that the addition operation is not yet implemented for this class. This method is crucial for enabling the use of the '+' operator with instances of the class.

The __add__ method is also indirectly called by the __radd__ method within the same class. The __radd__ method is designed to handle the addition operation when the instance appears on the right-hand side of the '+' operator. If the other operand is zero, __radd__ returns the instance itself, supporting the use of the sum function. Otherwise, it delegates the addition operation to the __add__ method.

**Note**: 
- The __add__ method currently raises a NotImplementedError, so attempting to use the '+' operator with instances of this class will result in an error.
- To enable addition, the __add__ method needs to be properly implemented.
- The __radd__ method relies on __add__ for non-zero operands, so both methods should be considered together when implementing addition functionality.
***
### FunctionDef __radd__(self, other)
**__radd__**: The function of __radd__ is to handle the addition operation when the instance appears on the right-hand side of the '+' operator.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· self: The instance of the class on which the method is called.
· other: The instance or value to be added to the instance represented by self.

**Code Description**: The __radd__ method is designed to support the addition operation when the instance of the class appears on the right-hand side of the '+' operator. This method is particularly useful for enabling the use of the sum function with instances of the class. When the other operand is zero, __radd__ returns the instance itself, ensuring that the sum function can correctly handle the initial zero value. If the other operand is not zero, the method delegates the addition operation to the __add__ method of the class.

The __add__ method, which is called by __radd__ for non-zero operands, is intended to define the behavior of the addition operation for instances of the class. However, in its current implementation, __add__ raises a NotImplementedError, indicating that the addition operation is not yet implemented for this class. Therefore, to fully enable addition functionality, the __add__ method needs to be properly implemented.

**Note**: 
- The __add__ method currently raises a NotImplementedError, so attempting to use the '+' operator with instances of this class will result in an error.
- The __radd__ method relies on __add__ for non-zero operands, so both methods should be considered together when implementing addition functionality.

**Output Example**: 
- If `other` is 0, the method returns the instance itself.
- If `other` is not 0, the method attempts to return the result of `self.__add__(other)`, which currently raises a NotImplementedError.
***
## ClassDef Propagator
**Propagator**: The function of Propagator is to propagate feedback from a child node to its parent nodes based on the provided rules and functions.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
- `override`: A dictionary that stores the override propagate functions for specific operator names.

**Code Description**: The Propagator class is a subclass of the AbstractPropagator class. It provides specific implementations for the `propagate` and `_propagate` methods, as well as additional functionalities such as registering custom propagation functions and initializing feedback.

- The `register` method allows users to register a custom propagate function for a specific operator name. It takes two parameters: `operator_name` (the name of the operator) and `propagate_function` (the custom propagate function). It adds the `operator_name` and `propagate_function` to the `override` dictionary.

- The `propagate` method is responsible for computing the propagated feedback to the parent nodes of the given `child` node. It takes a `child` parameter of type `MessageNode` and returns a dictionary where the keys are the parent nodes and the values are the propagated feedback. It first retrieves the operator name from the `child` node using the `get_op_name` function. If the operator name is found in the `override` dictionary, it calls the corresponding propagate function with the `child` node as the argument. Otherwise, it calls the `_propagate` method to compute the propagated feedback.

- The `init_feedback` method is an abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. It takes a `feedback` parameter and returns the initialized feedback object that will be propagated recursively. Since this method is not implemented in the Propagator class, it raises a `NotImplementedError` if called.

- The `_propagate` method is a protected method that computes the propagated feedback to the parent nodes based on the `child` node's description, data, and feedback. It takes a `child` parameter of type `MessageNode` and returns a dictionary where the keys are the parent nodes and the values are the propagated feedback. It first creates a list of tuples representing the parents of the `child` node. Then, it aggregates the feedback from the `child` node and creates a `TraceGraph` object. It also adds the external dependencies on parameters not visible in the current graph level. Finally, it returns a dictionary where the keys are the parent nodes and the values are the propagated feedback.

**Note**: 
- The `propagate` method must be implemented in any subclass of Propagator.
- The `init_feedback` and `_propagate` methods are abstract methods and must be implemented in subclasses.
- The `register` method allows users to register custom propagate functions for specific operator names, providing flexibility in the feedback propagation process.

**Output Example**: 
Given a properly implemented subclass of Propagator, the return value of the `propagate` method might look like the following:
```python
{
    parent_node_1: feedback_data_1,
    parent_node_2: feedback_data_2,
    # ... other parent nodes and their respective feedback
}
```
This dictionary maps parent nodes to their respective propagated feedback.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the Propagator class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor method for the Propagator class. When an instance of the Propagator class is created, this method is automatically called to set up the initial state of the object. Specifically, it initializes an instance variable named `override` as an empty dictionary. This dictionary is intended to store override propagation functions, where the keys are operator names and the values are the corresponding override functions. This setup allows for flexible and dynamic modification of propagation behavior based on specific operators.

**Note**: 
- The `override` dictionary is initially empty and can be populated later with operator names and their corresponding override functions.
- This method does not require any arguments and does not return any values.
- Proper management of the `override` dictionary is essential for ensuring the correct propagation behavior in the Propagator class.
***
### FunctionDef register(self, operator_name, propagate_function)
**register**: The function of register is to associate a given operator name with a specific propagation function.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· operator_name: The name of the operator to be registered.
· propagate_function: The function that defines how the operator should propagate.

**Code Description**: The register function is a method designed to add or override an entry in the `override` dictionary of the Propagator class. When called, it takes two arguments: `operator_name` and `propagate_function`. The `operator_name` is a string that identifies the operator, and `propagate_function` is a callable that defines the behavior of the operator during propagation. The method assigns the `propagate_function` to the `operator_name` key in the `override` dictionary, effectively registering or updating the propagation behavior for that operator.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `operator_name` is unique within the context of the `override` dictionary to avoid unintentional overwrites.
- The `propagate_function` should be a valid callable that adheres to the expected signature and behavior required by the Propagator class.
***
### FunctionDef propagate(self, child)
**propagate**: The function of propagate is to compute and return the propagated feedback to the parents of a given MessageNode based on the node's description, data, and feedback.

**parameters**:
- child: A MessageNode object representing the child node for which the feedback needs to be propagated.

**Code Description**:
The `propagate` function is a method of the `Propagator` class. It takes a child `MessageNode` as input and computes the propagated feedback to its parents. The function first checks if there is an override function defined for the operator associated with the child's description. If an override function is defined, it is called to compute the propagated feedback. Otherwise, the default `_propagate` function is called.

The purpose of the `propagate` function is to compute the propagated feedback from a child `MessageNode` to its parents. The feedback is computed based on the child's description, data, and feedback. The function returns a dictionary where the keys are the parents of the child and the values are the propagated feedback.

The `propagate` function provides a way to customize the propagation behavior for different types of operators. By defining an override function for a specific operator, developers can specify how the feedback should be propagated for that operator. This allows for flexibility and customization in the propagation process.

It is important to note that the `propagate` function relies on the `_propagate` function, which is a placeholder and needs to be implemented in a subclass of the `Propagator` class. The implementation of the `_propagate` function will depend on the specific requirements of the operator being propagated. The `_propagate` function raises a `NotImplementedError` to indicate that it needs to be implemented.

The `propagate` function is called by other parts of the project to propagate feedback from child nodes to parent nodes. It is an essential component of the graph propagation process and plays a crucial role in updating the values of parent nodes based on the feedback received from their child nodes.

**Note**:
- The `_propagate` function is a placeholder and needs to be implemented in a subclass of the `Propagator` class.
- The `propagate` function provides a way to customize the propagation behavior for different types of operators.
- The implementation of the `_propagate` function will depend on the specific requirements of the operator being propagated.
- The `propagate` function is an essential component of the graph propagation process and plays a crucial role in updating the values of parent nodes based on the feedback received from their child nodes.

**Output Example**:
If the `propagate` function is called with a child `MessageNode` object and the feedback is successfully propagated to its parents, the function will return a dictionary where the keys are the parent nodes and the values are the propagated feedback.
***
### FunctionDef init_feedback(self, feedback)
**init_feedback**: The function of init_feedback is to create a feedback object from raw feedback that will be propagated recursively.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· feedback: Raw feedback of any type that needs to be processed into a feedback object.

**Code Description**: The init_feedback function is designed to take raw feedback as input and transform it into a feedback object that can be propagated recursively through a system. This function is essential for initializing the feedback mechanism in a propagation process. The function is currently not implemented and raises a NotImplementedError, indicating that it is intended to be overridden in a subclass or implemented later.

In the context of its usage within the project, init_feedback is called by the backward method of the Node class in opto\trace\nodes.py. The backward method is responsible for performing a backward pass through a graph of nodes, propagating feedback from child nodes to parent nodes. During this process, init_feedback is used to initialize the feedback for the current node before it is propagated to its parents. This ensures that the feedback is in the correct format and ready for recursive propagation.

**Note**: 
- The init_feedback function must be implemented before it can be used effectively. 
- It is crucial to ensure that the feedback object created by this function is compatible with the propagation mechanism used in the backward method.
- Proper implementation of this function is necessary to avoid runtime errors and ensure the correct functioning of the feedback propagation process.
***
### FunctionDef _propagate(self, child)
**_propagate**: The function of _propagate is to compute and return the propagated feedback to the parents of a given MessageNode based on the node's description, data, and feedback.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the Propagator class.
- child: The MessageNode for which the feedback needs to be propagated.

**Code Description**:
The _propagate function is a method of the Propagator class. It takes a child MessageNode as input and computes the propagated feedback to its parents. The function first checks if there is an override function defined for the operator associated with the child's description. If an override function is defined, it is called to compute the propagated feedback. Otherwise, the default _propagate function is called.

The _propagate function raises a NotImplementedError, indicating that it needs to be implemented in a subclass of the Propagator class. This allows for customization of the propagation behavior for different types of operators.

The purpose of the _propagate function is to compute the propagated feedback from a child MessageNode to its parents. The feedback is computed based on the child's description, data, and feedback. The function returns a dictionary where the keys are the parents of the child and the values are the propagated feedback.

It is important to note that the _propagate function is a placeholder and needs to be implemented in a subclass of the Propagator class. The implementation of this function will depend on the specific requirements of the operator being propagated.

**Note**:
- The _propagate function is a placeholder and needs to be implemented in a subclass of the Propagator class.
- The function raises a NotImplementedError to indicate that it needs to be implemented.
- The implementation of the _propagate function will depend on the specific requirements of the operator being propagated.
***
## ClassDef SumPropagator
**SumPropagator**: The function of SumPropagator is to propagate feedback from a child node to its parent nodes by summing the feedback values.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
- This class does not define any additional attributes beyond those inherited from the Propagator class.

**Code Description**: The SumPropagator class is a subclass of the Propagator class. It provides specific implementations for the `init_feedback` and `_propagate` methods, which are abstract methods in the Propagator class.

- The `init_feedback` method takes a `feedback` parameter of any type and returns it as-is. This method is used to initialize the feedback object that will be propagated recursively.

- The `_propagate` method is responsible for computing the propagated feedback to the parent nodes of the given `child` node. It takes a `child` parameter of type `MessageNode` and returns a dictionary where the keys are the parent nodes and the values are the propagated feedback.

  - If the `child` node's feedback contains a "user" key, it asserts that the "user" feedback is the only feedback and that it contains exactly one item. It then extracts this feedback item.
  
  - If the "user" key is not present, it sums the feedback values from all keys in the `child` node's feedback. It asserts that the feedback list is not empty and that all feedback items are of the same type. If the feedback items are strings, it concatenates them; otherwise, it sums them numerically.
  
  - Finally, it returns a dictionary where each parent node of the `child` node is mapped to the computed feedback.

The SumPropagator class is used within the context of the opto.trace.propagators module, which deals with propagating feedback in a hierarchical structure of nodes. It overrides the abstract methods of the Propagator class to provide a specific feedback propagation mechanism based on summing feedback values.

**Note**: 
- The `init_feedback` method in SumPropagator simply returns the input feedback without any modifications.
- The `_propagate` method ensures that feedback values are either concatenated (if they are strings) or summed (if they are numeric), and it performs type checks to ensure consistency.

**Output Example**: 
Given a `child` node with feedback and parent nodes, the return value of the `_propagate` method might look like the following:
```python
{
    parent_node_1: summed_feedback,
    parent_node_2: summed_feedback,
    # ... other parent nodes and their respective feedback
}
```
This dictionary maps parent nodes to their respective propagated feedback, which is the sum of the feedback values from the `child` node.
### FunctionDef init_feedback(self, feedback)
**init_feedback**: The function of init_feedback is to initialize and return the provided feedback.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· feedback: Any type of input that represents the feedback to be initialized.

**Code Description**: The init_feedback function is designed to take a single parameter, feedback, which can be of any type. The function simply returns the feedback parameter as it is. This implies that the function's primary purpose is to serve as a placeholder or a pass-through for the feedback data, potentially for further processing or storage within the context of the SumPropagator class.

**Note**: 
- The function does not perform any validation or transformation on the feedback parameter.
- Ensure that the feedback parameter is provided in the expected format and type as required by the broader application context.

**Output Example**: 
If the feedback parameter is provided as a string "Positive feedback", the function will return "Positive feedback".
If the feedback parameter is provided as a dictionary {"score": 10, "comment": "Excellent"}, the function will return {"score": 10, "comment": "Excellent"}.
***
### FunctionDef _propagate(self, child)
**_propagate**: The function of _propagate is to calculate the feedback value for a given child node and propagate it to its parent nodes.
**parameters**:
- self: The current object.
- child: The child node for which the feedback needs to be propagated.
**Code Description**:
The `_propagate` function is a method of the `SumPropagator` class in the `propagators.py` module. It takes two parameters, `self` and `child`, where `self` refers to the current `SumPropagator` object and `child` is the child node for which the feedback needs to be propagated.

The function first checks if the child node has a feedback entry for the "user" key. If it does, it assumes that the user feedback is the only feedback and assigns it to the `feedback` variable. Otherwise, it sums up the feedback values from all the keys in the `child.feedback` dictionary and assigns it to the `feedback_list` variable.

Next, the function performs some assertions to ensure the validity of the feedback data. It checks if the `feedback_list` has at least one element and if all the elements in the list have the same type. If the elements are of type string, it concatenates them using the `"".join()` method and assigns the result to the `feedback` variable. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the elements using the `sum()` function and assigns it to the `feedback` variable.

Finally, the function creates a dictionary comprehension to map each parent node of the child node to the calculated feedback value. The parent nodes are obtained by calling the `parents()` function of the child node.

The `_propagate` function is an important part of the feedback propagation process in the graph structure. It ensures that the feedback from a child node is correctly calculated and propagated to its parent nodes. This is crucial for updating the parameters and optimizing the graph based on the feedback received.

**Note**: The `_propagate` function assumes that the feedback data is stored in the `child.feedback` dictionary, where the keys represent different sources of feedback and the values represent the corresponding feedback values. The function handles two scenarios: when there is only user feedback available and when there are multiple feedback sources that need to be summed up. It is important to ensure that the feedback data is correctly formatted and consistent with the expectations of the function.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
{
    parent_node_1: feedback_value_1,
    parent_node_2: feedback_value_2,
    ...
}
```
This example assumes that the `child.parents` attribute contains a list of parent nodes and the `feedback` variable contains the calculated feedback value for each parent node. The actual structure and content of the return value will depend on the specific implementation and use case within the project.
