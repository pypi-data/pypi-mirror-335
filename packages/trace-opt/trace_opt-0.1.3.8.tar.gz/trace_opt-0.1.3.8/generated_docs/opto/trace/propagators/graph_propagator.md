## ClassDef TraceGraph
**TraceGraph**: The function of TraceGraph is to serve as a feedback container used by the GraphPropagator. It represents a subgraph of nodes and stores user feedback.

**attributes**:
- graph: A list of Node objects representing the priority queue of nodes in the subgraph.
- user_feedback: Any type of user feedback associated with the TraceGraph.

**Code Description**:
The TraceGraph class is a feedback container used by the GraphPropagator. It is designed to store a subgraph of nodes and user feedback. The class includes the following methods:

1. `__add__(self, other)`: This method is used to combine two TraceGraph objects. It checks if either of the user feedbacks is None, and if so, it assigns the non-None user feedback to the resulting TraceGraph. If both user feedbacks are not None, it checks if they are equal and assigns the user feedback to the resulting TraceGraph. The graph is created by merging the two graphs and sorting them based on the priority level. The method returns a new TraceGraph object with the merged graph and user feedback.

**Note**: 
- The TraceGraph class inherits from the AbstractFeedback class, which defines the `__add__` method.
- The `__add__` method ensures that the user feedback is consistent when combining two TraceGraph objects.

**Output Example**:
```python
TraceGraph(graph=[(1, Node('A')), (2, Node('B'))], user_feedback=None)
```

**Reference Relationship**:
- The TraceGraph class is called by the `__add__` method in the TraceGraph class itself.
- The TraceGraph class is utilized in the `node_to_function_feedback` function in the `opto.optimizers.function_optimizer` module.
- The TraceGraph class is also used in the `init_feedback` method of the GraphPropagator class in the `opto.trace.propagators.graph_propagator` module.
### FunctionDef __add__(self, other)
**__add__**: The function of __add__ is to merge two TraceGraph objects while ensuring consistency in user feedback and combining their graphs.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· self: The first instance of the TraceGraph object.
· other: The second instance of the TraceGraph object to be added to the first.

**Code Description**: The __add__ method begins by asserting that at least one of the user_feedback attributes from the two TraceGraph objects is not None. If both user_feedback attributes are None, an assertion error is raised with the message "One of the user feedback should not be None."

Next, the method determines the user_feedback for the resulting TraceGraph. If one of the user_feedback attributes is None, it uses the non-None user_feedback. If both are not None, it asserts that they are equal, ensuring consistency, and then uses the user_feedback from the first TraceGraph.

The method then constructs a list of names from the nodes in the other TraceGraph's graph. It creates a complement list by including nodes from the first TraceGraph's graph that do not have names present in the other TraceGraph's graph. This ensures that nodes with the same name are not duplicated.

Finally, the method merges the complement list and the other TraceGraph's graph using heapq.merge, which merges the lists based on the first element of each tuple (assumed to be a key). The merged list is used to create a new TraceGraph object, which is returned with the combined graph and the determined user_feedback.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that at least one of the TraceGraph objects has a non-None user_feedback before using the __add__ method.
- If both TraceGraph objects have user_feedback, they must be identical to avoid an assertion error.

**Output Example**: 
Assuming TraceGraph objects `tg1` and `tg2` are being added:
```python
tg1 + tg2
```
This would return a new TraceGraph object with a combined graph and consistent user_feedback.

## ClassDef GraphPropagator
**GraphPropagator**: The GraphPropagator class is a subclass of the Propagator class. It provides specific implementations for the `init_feedback` and `_propagate` methods, as well as an `aggregate` method. The purpose of this class is to collect all the nodes seen in the path and compute the propagated feedback to the parent nodes based on the child node's description, data, and feedback.

**attributes**:
- None

**Code Description**:
- The `init_feedback` method takes two parameters: `node` (the current node) and `feedback` (the user feedback). It returns a TraceGraph object that represents the initial feedback for the given node. The TraceGraph object is created using the TraceGraph class and initialized with the current node and the user feedback.

- The `_propagate` method takes a `child` parameter of type `MessageNode` and computes the propagated feedback to the parent nodes based on the child node's description, data, and feedback. It first creates a list of tuples representing the parents of the child node. Each tuple contains the level of the parent node and the parent node itself. Then, it aggregates the feedback from the child node and creates a TraceGraph object using the TraceGraph class. The aggregated feedback is computed by adding the feedback from the child node to a TraceGraph object that represents the parents of the child node. The external dependencies on parameters not visible in the current graph level are also included in the feedback. Finally, the method returns a dictionary where the keys are the parent nodes and the values are the propagated feedback.

- The `aggregate` method takes a `feedback` parameter of type `Dict[Node, List[TraceGraph]]` and aggregates the feedback from multiple children. It first checks that the length of each value in the feedback dictionary is 1 and that each value is an instance of the TraceGraph class. Then, it sums the feedback values and returns the aggregated feedback as a TraceGraph object.

**Note**:
- The `init_feedback` and `_propagate` methods are specific implementations of abstract methods defined in the Propagator class.
- The `aggregate` method is a helper method used by the `_propagate` method to aggregate feedback from multiple children.

**Output Example**:
Given a properly implemented GraphPropagator object, the return value of the `_propagate` method might look like the following:
```python
{
    parent_node_1: feedback_data_1,
    parent_node_2: feedback_data_2,
    # ... other parent nodes and their respective feedback
}
```
### FunctionDef init_feedback(self, node, feedback)
**init_feedback**: The function of init_feedback is to initialize feedback for a given node in the GraphPropagator.

**parameters**:
- node: The node for which feedback is being initialized.
- feedback: The user feedback associated with the node.

**Code Description**:
The init_feedback function is a method of the GraphPropagator class in the opto.trace.propagators.graph_propagator module. It is used to initialize feedback for a given node in the graph propagation process. The function takes two parameters: the node for which feedback is being initialized and the user feedback associated with the node.

Inside the function, a TraceGraph object is created using the TraceGraph class. The TraceGraph object is initialized with a graph containing a single tuple representing the level of the node and the node itself. The user feedback is also assigned to the TraceGraph object.

The TraceGraph object is then returned as the output of the init_feedback function.

**Reference Relationship**:
- The init_feedback function is called by the backward method in the Node class in the opto.trace.nodes module.
- The init_feedback function is called by the propagate method in the GraphPropagator class in the opto.trace.propagators.graph_propagator module.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the node and feedback parameters are properly provided when calling the init_feedback function to avoid potential issues.

**Output Example**:
If the node parameter is a Node object representing a node with level 2 and the feedback parameter is "Good job!", calling the init_feedback function will return a TraceGraph object with the following attributes:
- graph: [(2, Node)]
- user_feedback: "Good job!"
***
### FunctionDef _propagate(self, child)
**_propagate**: The function of _propagate is to propagate feedback from a child node to its parent nodes in the graph.

**parameters**:
- self: The current object.
- child: The child node from which the feedback is propagated.

**Code Description**:
The `_propagate` function is a method of the `GraphPropagator` class in the `graph_propagator.py` module. It takes in the current object (`self`) and a child node (`child`) as parameters. The function first creates a list called `graph` by iterating over the parents of the child node and storing them along with their priority level. The priority level is determined by the `level` attribute of each parent node. The `graph` list represents the parents of the child node.

Next, the function aggregates the feedback from the child node by calling the `aggregate` method of the current object (`self`). The `aggregate` method takes in the feedback from multiple children nodes and returns the aggregated feedback as a `TraceGraph` object. The feedback is obtained from the `feedback` attribute of the child node.

The function then asserts that the aggregated feedback is an instance of the `TraceGraph` class. This ensures that the feedback is in the correct format.

After that, the function iterates over the external dependencies of the child node and adds the feedback to each external dependency by calling the `_add_feedback` method of the external dependency node. This ensures that the feedback is correctly propagated to the external dependencies.

Finally, the function returns a dictionary comprehension that maps each parent node to the aggregated feedback.

The `_propagate` function is an essential part of the graph propagation process in the `GraphPropagator` class. It is responsible for propagating feedback from a child node to its parent nodes, ensuring that the feedback flows correctly through the graph structure.

**Note**: 
- The function assumes that the child node has a `parents` attribute that returns a list of parent nodes.
- The function assumes that the child node has an `external_dependencies` attribute that returns a set of external dependency nodes.
- The function assumes that the child node has a `feedback` attribute that contains the feedback from the child node.
- The function assumes that the feedback can be aggregated using the `aggregate` method.
- The function assumes that the external dependencies have a `_add_feedback` method to add the feedback from the child node.
- The function returns a dictionary that maps each parent node to the aggregated feedback.

**Output Example**: 
If the child node has two parents, the `_propagate` function will return a dictionary with two key-value pairs, where each key represents a parent node and the corresponding value represents the aggregated feedback from the child node.
```python
{
    parent_node1: aggregated_feedback1,
    parent_node2: aggregated_feedback2
}
```
***
### FunctionDef aggregate(self, feedback)
**aggregate**: The function of aggregate is to aggregate feedback from multiple children.

**Parameters**:
- feedback: A dictionary that maps a Node to a list of TraceGraph objects representing the feedback from the child nodes.

**Code Description**:
The `aggregate` function takes in a dictionary of feedback from multiple children. It first checks that each child has provided exactly one feedback and that the feedback is of type TraceGraph. Then, it calculates the sum of the feedback values for each child and stores them in a list called `values`. If the length of `values` is zero, indicating that there is no feedback, it returns a TraceGraph object with an empty graph and a user_feedback attribute set to None. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the values.

This function is used to aggregate the feedback received from multiple children nodes. It ensures that the feedback is valid and performs the aggregation by summing the feedback values. The resulting aggregated feedback is returned as a TraceGraph object.

**Reference Relationship**:
- This function is called by the `summarize` method in the `FunctionOptimizer` class in the `opto.optimizers.function_optimizer` module.
- This function is also called by the `_propagate` method in the `GraphPropagator` class in the `opto.trace.propagators.graph_propagator` module.

**Note**:
- The feedback dictionary should contain exactly one feedback value for each child node.
- The feedback values should be of type TraceGraph.
- The function assumes that the feedback values can be summed.
- If there is no feedback, an empty TraceGraph object is returned.
- The function does not modify the input feedback dictionary.

**Output Example**:
```python
TraceGraph(graph=[(1, Node('A')), (2, Node('B'))], user_feedback=None)
```
