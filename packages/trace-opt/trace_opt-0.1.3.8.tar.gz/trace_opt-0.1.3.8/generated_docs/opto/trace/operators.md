## FunctionDef clone(x)
**clone**: The function of clone is to create a deep copy of the input object `x`.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: The object to be cloned. It can be of any type.

**Code Description**: The `clone` function is designed to generate a deep copy of the provided object `x`. This is achieved using the `copy.deepcopy` method from Python's `copy` module. A deep copy means that all levels of the object are copied recursively, ensuring that the new object is entirely independent of the original. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex objects that contain nested structures, as it prevents changes in the cloned object from affecting the original object and vice versa.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `copy` module is imported before using the `clone` function.
- Be aware that deep copying can be resource-intensive for large or complex objects, as it involves duplicating every element within the object.

**Output Example**: 
If `x` is a list `[1, 2, [3, 4]]`, calling `clone(x)` will return a new list `[1, 2, [3, 4]]` that is a deep copy of `x`. Changes to the nested list in the cloned object will not affect the original list.
## FunctionDef identity(x)
**identity**: The function of identity is to return a duplicate of the input object.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: Any - The input object that will be duplicated.

**Code Description**: The identity function takes a single parameter, x, and returns a duplicate of this parameter by calling its clone method. The clone method is a part of the Node class, which creates and returns a duplicate of the current Node object. When identity is called with an object, it effectively behaves the same as calling the clone method on that object. This ensures that the original object remains unmodified, and a new instance with the same attributes and states is returned.

The identity function is integral to operations that require object duplication within the project. It relies on the clone method from the Node class, which imports the clone function from the opto.trace.operators module and applies it to the current instance of the Node class. This standardized operation ensures consistency in how objects are duplicated across the project.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input object x has a clone method implemented; otherwise, the identity function will raise an AttributeError.
- The identity function does not modify the original object; it only creates and returns a duplicate.

**Output Example**: If the input object x is an instance of the Node class with specific attributes and states, the return value of the identity function will be a new instance of the Node class that is a duplicate of the original instance. For example, if the original Node instance has attributes like name and value, the cloned instance will have the same name and value.
## FunctionDef pos(x)
**pos**: The function of pos is to return the unary positive of the input value x.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: Any - The input value to which the unary positive operator will be applied.

This function is useful in contexts where the unary positive operator needs to be explicitly applied to a value.

In the project, the pos function is called by the __pos__ method of the Node class located in opto\trace\nodes.py. When the unary positive operator is used on an instance of the Node class (e.g., +node_instance), the __pos__ method is invoked, which in turn calls the pos function from the opto.trace.operators module. This ensures that the unary positive operation is consistently applied to instances of the Node class.

**Note**: 
- The pos function does not alter the input value; it simply returns it.
- Ensure that the input value x is of a type that supports the unary positive operator.

**Output Example**: 
If the input value x is 5, the return value will be 5.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input x is a type that supports the absolute value operation, such as int, float, or any custom object that implements the __abs__ method.
- The function relies on Python's built-in abs() function, so its behavior and limitations are consistent with that.

**Output Example**: 
- If x is -5, the function will return 5.

## FunctionDef cond(condition, x, y)
**cond**: The function of cond is to select and return `x` if `condition` is True, otherwise it returns `y`.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· condition: A boolean or any value that can be evaluated as a boolean.
· x: The value to be returned if `condition` is True.
· y: The value to be returned if `condition` is False.

**Code Description**: The `cond` function is a simple utility that evaluates a given `condition` and returns one of two provided values based on the result of that evaluation. Specifically, if `condition` evaluates to True, the function returns `x`; otherwise, it returns `y`. 

The function begins by ensuring that all input data (`x`, `y`, and `condition`) are read and assigned to local variables. This step is somewhat redundant in this context but ensures that the inputs are processed. The core logic is implemented in a single return statement that uses a conditional expression (ternary operator) to decide which value to return based on the truthiness of `condition`.

This function is called in the project by unit tests located in `tests\unit_tests\test_nodes.py`. These tests likely verify the correctness of the `cond` function by passing various conditions and corresponding values for `x` and `y`, ensuring that the function returns the expected result in each case.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `condition` is a value that can be evaluated as a boolean.
- The function does not perform any type checking or validation on the inputs.

**Output Example**: 
- If `condition` is True, `x` is returned.
- If `condition` is False, `y` is returned.

For instance:
- `cond(True, 'apple', 'orange')` returns `'apple'`.
- `cond(False, 'apple', 'orange')` returns `'orange'`.
## FunctionDef not_(x)
**not_**: The function of not_ is to return the logical negation of the input value x.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: Any - The input value to be negated.

**Code Description**: The not_ function takes a single parameter x of any type and returns the logical negation of x. In Python, the logical negation operator `not` is used to invert the truth value of the operand. If x is a truthy value (e.g., True, non-zero numbers, non-empty collections), the function will return False. Conversely, if x is a falsy value (e.g., False, 0, None, empty collections), the function will return True. This function is useful for scenarios where you need to invert the boolean value of a given input.

**Note**: 
- The input parameter x can be of any type, but the function will evaluate its truthiness according to Python's standard rules for boolean context.
- Ensure that the input value is appropriate for logical negation to avoid unexpected results.

**Output Example**: 
- not_(True) will return False.
- not_(0) will return True.
- not_([1, 2, 3]) will return False.
- not_('') will return True.
## FunctionDef is_(x, y)
**is_**: The function of is_ is to determine whether x is equal to y using identity comparison.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: The first object to be compared.
· y: The second object to be compared.

**Code Description**: The is_ function checks if the two provided arguments, x and y, are the same object in memory. This is done using the identity operator `is`, which returns True if both x and y refer to the same object, and False otherwise. This type of comparison is different from the equality operator `==`, which checks if the values of the objects are equal, not necessarily if they are the same object.

**Note**: 
- Use this function when you need to verify that two variables point to the exact same object, not just equivalent values.
- This function is particularly useful when dealing with singleton objects or when you need to ensure that two references are indeed pointing to the same memory location.

**Output Example**: 
- `is_(a, b)` returns `True` if `a` and `b` are the same object.
- `is_(a, b)` returns `False` if `a` and `b` are different objects, even if they have the same content.
## FunctionDef is_not(x, y)
**is_not**: The function of is_not is to determine whether two variables, `x` and `y`, are not the same object in memory.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: The first variable to be compared.
· y: The second variable to be compared.

**Code Description**: The `is_not` function checks if the two provided variables, `x` and `y`, do not refer to the same object in memory. This is achieved using the `is not` operator in Python, which returns `True` if `x` and `y` are not the same object, and `False` otherwise. This function is useful when you need to ensure that two variables are distinct objects, rather than just having the same value.

**Note**: 
- This function checks for object identity, not equality of values. Two different objects with the same value will still return `True`.
- This function is particularly useful in scenarios where object identity is crucial, such as when dealing with mutable objects or singleton patterns.

**Output Example**: 
- `is_not(5, 5)` would return `False` because both `5`s are the same immutable integer object.
- `is_not([], [])` would return `True` because each `[]` creates a new list object in memory.
- `is_not(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are references to the same object would return `False`.
## FunctionDef in_(x, y)
**in_**: The function of in_ is to determine whether an element x is present within a collection y.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: The element to be checked for presence within the collection y.
· y: The collection in which the presence of element x is to be checked.

**Code Description**: The in_ function takes two parameters, x and y, and returns a boolean value indicating whether x is present in y. This is achieved using Python's built-in membership operator `in`, which checks for the presence of an element within a collection such as a list, tuple, set, or dictionary. The function is straightforward and leverages Python's efficient membership testing capabilities.

In the context of its usage within the project, the in_ function is called by the __contains__ method of the Node class in the opto\trace\nodes.py module. The __contains__ method uses the in_ function to determine if a given item is part of the Node instance. This is done by importing the in_ function from the opto.trace.operators module and applying it to the item and the Node instance itself. This integration ensures that the Node class can utilize the in_ function to perform membership tests, thereby enhancing its functionality.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the collection y supports the membership test operation.
- The function will raise a TypeError if y is not a collection type that supports the `in` operator.

**Output Example**: 
- If x is 3 and y is [1, 2, 3, 4], the function will return True.
- If x is 'a' and y is 'hello', the function will return False.
## FunctionDef not_in(x, y)
**not_in**: The function of not_in is to determine whether a given element `x` is not present within another collection `y`.

**parameters**: The parameters of this function.
· x: The element to be checked for non-membership within the collection `y`.
· y: The collection in which the presence of the element `x` is to be checked.

**Code Description**: The not_in function takes two parameters, `x` and `y`. It evaluates whether the element `x` is not contained within the collection `y`. The function returns a boolean value: `True` if `x` is not in `y`, and `False` if `x` is in `y`. This is achieved using the `not in` operator in Python, which checks for non-membership.

**Note**: 
- The collection `y` can be any iterable, such as a list, tuple, set, or string.
- The function does not modify the input parameters.
- Ensure that `y` is a valid iterable to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: 
- `not_in(3, [1, 2, 4, 5])` returns `True` because 3 is not in the list `[1, 2, 4, 5]`.
- `not_in('a', 'apple')` returns `False` because 'a' is in the string 'apple'.
## FunctionDef getitem(x, index)
**getitem**: The function of getitem is to retrieve an element from a given object `x` using the specified `index`.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: The object from which an element is to be retrieved. This can be any type that supports indexing, such as lists, tuples, or dictionaries.
· index: The index or key used to access the element within the object `x`.

**Code Description**: The getitem function is a straightforward implementation of the indexing operation. It takes two parameters: `x` and `index`. The function returns the element of `x` located at the position specified by `index`. This is achieved using the standard indexing syntax `x[index]`.

In the context of its usage within the project, the getitem function is called by the `__getitem__` method of the `Node` class in the `opto.trace.nodes` module. When the `__getitem__` method is invoked on a `Node` instance with a specific key, it imports the getitem function from the `opto.trace.operators` module and uses it to retrieve the corresponding element from the `Node` instance. This allows for a modular and reusable approach to element retrieval within the project.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the object `x` supports the indexing operation with the provided `index`. Otherwise, an error will be raised.
- The type of `index` should be compatible with the indexing mechanism of the object `x`.

**Output Example**: 
If `x` is a list `[10, 20, 30]` and `index` is `1`, the return value of `getitem(x, index)` will be `20`.
## FunctionDef pop(x, index)
**pop**: The function of pop is to remove and return an element from a list `x` at the specified `index`.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: The list from which an element will be removed.
· index: The position of the element to be removed from the list.

**Code Description**: The `pop` function is designed to operate on a list `x` and remove the element located at the specified `index`. The function utilizes the built-in `pop` method of Python lists, which not only removes the element at the given index but also returns it. This allows the user to both modify the list by removing an element and capture the removed element for further use. The function is straightforward and leverages Python's native list handling capabilities to achieve its purpose efficiently.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `index` provided is within the valid range of the list `x`. If the `index` is out of range, a `IndexError` will be raised.
- The list `x` will be modified in place, meaning the original list will be changed after the function call.

**Output Example**: 
If `x = [10, 20, 30, 40]` and `index = 2`, calling `pop(x, index)` will return `30` and modify `x` to `[10, 20, 40]`.
## FunctionDef len_(x)
**len_**: The function of len_ is to return the length of the input object x.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: Any - The input object whose length is to be calculated.

**Code Description**: The len_ function is a utility that computes and returns the length of the input object x by leveraging Python's built-in len() function. This function is designed to be a simple wrapper around the built-in len() function, providing a consistent interface for length calculation within the project.

The function is called by the len method of the Node class in the opto\trace\nodes.py module. When the len method of a Node instance is invoked, it imports the len_ function from the opto.trace.operators module and applies it to the Node instance. This design allows the Node class to utilize the len_ function for determining its length, ensuring modularity and reusability of the len_ function across different parts of the project.

**Note**: Ensure that the input object x is of a type that supports the len() operation, such as lists, strings, tuples, or other collections. Passing an unsupported type will result in a TypeError.

**Output Example**: 
- If x is a list [1, 2, 3], len_(x) will return 3.
- If x is a string "hello", len_(x) will return 5.
## FunctionDef ord_(x)
**ord_**: The function of ord_ is to return the Unicode number of a character.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: Any - The character whose Unicode number is to be returned.

**Code Description**: The ord_ function takes a single parameter, x, which is expected to be a character. It returns the Unicode code point of that character using Python's built-in ord() function. The ord() function is a standard Python function that converts a single character into its corresponding Unicode integer value. This is useful for various applications, such as encoding, decoding, and character manipulation.

**Note**: 
- The input parameter x should be a single character. If x is not a single character, the ord() function will raise a TypeError.
- This function is designed to handle any character that can be represented in Unicode.

**Output Example**: 
- ord_('A') will return 65.
- ord_('€') will return 8364.
## FunctionDef chr_(x)

This function is useful for converting numerical Unicode values into their string character equivalents.

**Note**: 
- The input parameter x must be a valid Unicode code point. If x is not a valid Unicode code point, a ValueError will be raised.
- The function does not perform any type checking or validation on the input parameter, so it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that x is a valid integer within the Unicode range.

**Output Example**: 
- chr_(65) will return 'A'.
- chr_(8364) will return '€'.
## FunctionDef concat(x, y)
**concat**: The function of concat is to concatenate two given inputs, x and y.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: The first input to be concatenated. It can be of any type.
· y: The second input to be concatenated. It can be of any type.

**Code Description**: The concat function takes two parameters, x and y, and returns their concatenation using the + operator. This function is designed to handle inputs of any type, leveraging Python's dynamic typing and the + operator's ability to concatenate various data types such as strings, lists, and tuples. 

In the context of its usage within the project, the concat function is called by the __add__ method of the Node class in the opto\trace\nodes.py module. When the __add__ method is invoked, it checks the type of the _data attribute of the Node instance. If _data is a string, the concat function is used to concatenate the current Node instance with another Node instance created from the other parameter. This ensures that string concatenation is handled appropriately within the Node class.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the types of x and y are compatible with the + operator to avoid TypeErrors.
- The behavior of the + operator varies depending on the types of x and y. For example, it concatenates strings and lists but adds numbers.

**Output Example**: 
- If x is "Hello" and y is "World", the return value will be "HelloWorld".
- If x is [1, 2] and y is [3, 4], the return value will be [1, 2, 3, 4].
- If x is (1, 2) and y is (3, 4), the return value will be (1, 2, 3, 4).

· x: The main string that needs to be split.
· y: The substring used as the delimiter to split the main string `x`.
· maxsplit: An optional parameter that specifies the maximum number of splits to perform. The default value is -1, which means no limit on the number of splits.

**Code Description**: The `split` function takes three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `maxsplit`. It utilizes Python's built-in `split` method to divide the string `x` into parts wherever the substring `y` occurs. The `maxsplit` parameter controls the maximum number of splits that can be performed. If `maxsplit` is not provided, or if it is set to -1, the function will split the string at all occurrences of the substring `y`. The function returns a list containing the parts of the string `x` that were separated by the substring `y`.

**Note**: 
- The function will return a list of strings.
- If the substring `y` is not found in the main string `x`, the function will return a list containing the original string `x` as its only element.
- If `maxsplit` is set to 0, the function will return a list containing the original string `x` as its only element, as no splitting will be performed.

**Output Example**: 
```python
split("hello world", " ") 
# Output: ['hello', 'world']

split("apple,banana,cherry", ",", 1) 
# Output: ['apple', 'banana,cherry']

· count: The maximum number of occurrences to replace. If not specified, all occurrences will be replaced. The default value is -1, which means replace all occurrences.

**Code Description**: The replace function takes four parameters: x, old, new, and count. It utilizes the built-in string method `replace` to substitute all instances of the substring specified by `old` with the substring specified by `new` within the string `x`. The `count` parameter controls the number of replacements to be made. If `count` is set to -1 (the default value), all occurrences of the substring `old` will be replaced by `new`. If `count` is a positive integer, only that many occurrences of `old` will be replaced.

**Note**: 
- The function is case-sensitive, meaning that it will only replace substrings that match the case of `old`.
- If `old` is not found in `x`, the original string `x` will be returned unchanged.
- The `count` parameter must be a non-negative integer or -1.

**Output Example**: 
- replace("hello world", "world", "there") returns "hello there".
- replace("hello world world", "world", "there", 1) returns "hello there world".
- replace("hello world", "WORLD", "there") returns "hello world" (case-sensitive).
## FunctionDef format(x)
**format**: The function of format is to fill in a string template with content using the str.format() method.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A string template that contains placeholders to be filled.
· *args: Positional arguments to be used for filling the placeholders in the string template.
· **kwargs: Keyword arguments to be used for filling the placeholders in the string template.

**Code Description**: The format function takes a string template `x` and fills it with the provided positional (`*args`) and keyword arguments (`**kwargs`). It leverages Python's built-in `str.format()` method to perform this operation. The `str.format()` method allows for complex string formatting operations, including the insertion of variables, formatting of numbers, and more. By passing the arguments and keyword arguments to `x.format(*args, **kwargs)`, the function dynamically replaces the placeholders in the string template with the corresponding values.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the string template `x` contains valid placeholders that match the provided arguments.
- The function will raise a `KeyError` if a placeholder in the template does not have a corresponding keyword argument.
- The function will raise an `IndexError` if a placeholder in the template does not have a corresponding positional argument.

**Output Example**: 
If the function is called as follows:
```python
format("Hello, {}!", "World")
```
The return value will be:
```python
"Hello, World!"
```

If the function is called with keyword arguments:
```python
format("Hello, {name}!", name="Alice")
```
The return value will be:
```python
"Hello, Alice!"
```
## FunctionDef node_getattr(obj, attr)
**node_getattr**: The function of node_getattr is to get the value of the specified attribute from the given object.

**Parameters**:
- obj: A Node object from which the attribute value is to be retrieved.
- attr: A string representing the name of the attribute to be retrieved.

**Code Description**:
The `node_getattr` function takes in a `Node` object `obj` and a string `attr` as parameters. It first checks if the `obj` is an instance of a dictionary. If it is, it retrieves the value associated with the `attr` key from the dictionary. Otherwise, it uses the `getattr` function to retrieve the value of the `attr` attribute from the `obj`.

This function is used in the `getattr` method of the `Node` class in the `opto.trace.nodes.py` module. The `getattr` method is responsible for getting the value of the specified attribute from the `Node` object. It calls the `node_getattr` function passing itself (`self`) and the specified attribute (`key`) as arguments.

**Note**:
- The `node_getattr` function assumes that the `obj` parameter is a valid `Node` object.
- If the `obj` is not an instance of a dictionary and does not have the specified attribute, a `AttributeError` will be raised.

**Output Example**:
If `obj` is a dictionary and contains the attribute `attr`, the function will return the value associated with the `attr` key. Otherwise, it will return the value of the `attr` attribute from the `obj`.
## FunctionDef call(fun)
**call**: The function of call is to call the function `fun` with the provided arguments `args` and `kwargs`.

**parameters**:
- `fun`: A Node object representing the function to be called.
- `*args`: Variable-length argument list.
- `**kwargs`: Keyword arguments.

**Code Description**:
The `call` function takes a `fun` parameter, which is a Node object representing the function to be called. It also accepts variable-length arguments `args` and keyword arguments `kwargs`. The purpose of this function is to call the function `fun` with the provided arguments.

First, the function assigns the value of `fun` to a local variable `fun` by accessing the `_data` attribute of the `fun` object. This allows the function to work with the actual function object rather than the Node object.

Next, the function checks if the `fun` object is callable using the `callable()` function. If it is not callable, an `AssertionError` is raised with the message "The function must be callable."

Then, the function calls the `fun` function with the provided arguments `args` and keyword arguments `kwargs` using the `*args` and `**kwargs` syntax. The result of the function call is stored in the `output` variable.

Finally, the function returns the `output` variable.

**Note**:
- The `fun` parameter must be a callable function.
- The `args` parameter can accept any number of positional arguments.
- The `kwargs` parameter can accept any number of keyword arguments.

**Output Example**:
If the `fun` function is defined as follows:
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
and the `call` function is called with `fun=add` and `args=(2, 3)`, the output will be `5`.
