# Ableton Live MCP Server

## üìå Overview
The **Ableton Live MCP Server** is a server implementing the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) to facilitate communication between LLMs and **Ableton Live**. It uses **OSC (Open Sound Control)** to send and receive messages to/from Ableton Live.
It is based on [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC) implementation and exhaustively maps available OSC adresses to [**tools**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) accessible to MCP clients.


[![ontrol Ableton Live with LLMs](https://img.youtube.com/vi/12MzsQ3V7cs/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12MzsQ3V7cs)

This project consists of two main components:
- `mcp_ableton_server.py`: The MCP server handling the communication between clients and the OSC daemon.
- `osc_daemon.py`: The OSC daemon responsible for relaying commands to Ableton Live and processing responses.

## ‚ú® Features
- Provides an MCP-compatible API for controlling Ableton Live from MCP clients.
- Uses **python-osc** for sending and receiving OSC messages.
- Based on the OSC implementation from [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC).
- Implements request-response handling for Ableton Live commands.

## ‚ö° Installation

### Option 1: Install with UV (Recommended)

1. Install UV if you don't have it already:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

2. Install directly from PyPI:
   ```bash
   uv install ableton-live-mcp-server
   ```

3. Or install from GitHub:
   ```bash
   uv install git+https://github.com/mrmos/ableton-live-mcp-server.git
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Install `uv`
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcp_ableton_server.git
   cd mcp_ableton_server
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv install python-osc fastmcp
   ```
4. Install the MCP Server
   This assumes that you're using [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
   ```bash
   mcp install mcp_ableton_server.py
   ```
5. Install AbletonOSC
   Follow the instructions at [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC)
   
## üöÄ Usage

### Important: Running Both Components

This system requires **two separate processes** to be running simultaneously:

1. **OSC Daemon**: Communicates with Ableton Live via OSC
2. **MCP Server**: Connects LLMs to the OSC daemon

### Step 1: Run the OSC Daemon
First, start the OSC daemon to handle OSC communication between the MCP server and Ableton Live:
```bash
# If installed via UV:
ableton-osc-daemon

# Or if running from source:
python osc_daemon.py
```
This will:
- Listen for MCP client connections on port **65432**.
- Forward messages to Ableton Live via OSC on port **11000**.
- Receive OSC responses from Ableton on port **11001**.

### Step 2: Run the MCP Server
In a separate terminal window, start the MCP server to enable LLMs to control Ableton:
```bash
# If installed via UV:
ableton-mcp-server

# Or if running from source:
python mcp_ableton_server.py
```

### Quick Start Script
For convenience, you can use this script to start both components in the background:
```bash
# Start the OSC daemon
ableton-osc-daemon &
# Wait a moment for the daemon to start
sleep 2
# Start the MCP server
ableton-mcp-server
```

### Example Usage
In Claude desktop, ask Claude:
*Prepare a set to record a rock band*
*Set the input routing channel of all tracks that have "voice" in their name to Ext. In 2*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
By default, the server and daemon run on **localhost (127.0.0.1)** with the following ports:
- **MCP Server Socket:** 65432
- **Ableton Live OSC Port (Send):** 11000
- **Ableton Live OSC Port (Receive):** 11001

To modify these, edit the `AbletonOSCDaemon` class in `osc_daemon.py` or use command-line parameters:
```bash
ableton-osc-daemon --socket-port 65432 --ableton-port 11000 --receive-port 11001
```

### Claude Desktop Configurations
- macOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`


```json
"mcpServers": {
"Ableton Live Controller": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "ableton-mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
```

## Contributing
Feel free to submit issues, feature requests, or pull requests to improve this project.

## Publishing Updates
To publish new versions using UV:

1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Build the package:
   ```bash
   uv build
   ```
3. Publish to PyPI:
   ```bash
   uv publish
   ```
