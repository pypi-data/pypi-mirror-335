    A specialized Image object that supports grid-based processing and overlay visualization.

    This class extends the base `Image` class functionality to include grid handling,
    grid-based slicing, and advanced visualization capabilities such as displaying overlay information
    with gridlines and annotations. It interacts with the provided grid handling utilities
    to determine grid structure and assign/overlay it effectively on the image.
