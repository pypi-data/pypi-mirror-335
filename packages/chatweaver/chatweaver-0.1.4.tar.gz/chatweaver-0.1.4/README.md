## Installation
Install ChatWeaver using pip:

```bash
pip install chatweaver
```

---

## Quick Start

Hereâ€™s how you can get started with ChatWeaver:

```python
import chatweaver as cw

model = cw.Model(
    model="gpt-4o", 
    api_key="<Your OpenAI API key here>"
    )

bot = cw.Bot(
    rules=cw.chat_weaver_rules["basic"], 
    name="AiBot", 
    cw_model=model
    )

chat = cw.Chat(
    replies_limit=10, 
    user="Diego", 
    cw_bot=bot
    )

prompt = "Hi how are you?"
print(chat.get_response(prompt=prompt))
```

### Include images and files

You may also include images and files in the prompt by specifying their file paths.
```python
prompt = "Describe the content of the attached image."
image = "path\\to\\image.png"
print(chat.get_response(prompt=prompt, image_path=image))
```

### Implementation of Model Rules

ChatWeaver allows the customization of chatbot behavior through a set of predefined rules, defined in the variable `chat_weaver_rules`. These rules determine the role, style, format, and ethical guidelines the bot must follow. Each rule is designed to suit specific scenarios, enhancing interactivity and consistency in the conversation.

### Available Rules

1. **basic**: Sets the bot with scientifically accurate and reliable goals. Includes:
   - No text formatting.
   - Friendly and respectful communication.
   - Complete and contextual responses.
   - Strict ethical standards.
2. **default**: Optimizes the bot to keep the conversation flowing in a JSON format. Main features:
   - Single-line responses using `\n`.
   - JSON structure with keys like `reasoning`, `reply`, `result`.
3. **informal_chat**: Adjusts the bot for informal conversations. Key features:
   - Friendly and conversational language.
   - Simple JSON response format.
4. **formal_chat**: Adapts the bot for formal conversations. Includes:
   - Polite and respectful communication.
   - Formal JSON structure.
5. **formal_email**: Optimizes the bot for formal email exchanges. Features:
   - Adherence to email structure with greetings, body, and closing.
   - Detailed JSON responses.

### Implementation Example

To use a specific rule in your bot:

```python
import chatweaver as cw

# Configure the model
model = cw.Model(
    model="gpt-4o",
    api_key="<Your OpenAI API key here>"
)

# Configure the bot with a specific rule
bot = cw.Bot(
    rules=cw.chat_weaver_rules["basic"],
    name="AiBot",
    cw_model=model
)

# Create the chat
chat = cw.Chat(
    replies_limit=10,
    user="Diego",
    cw_bot=bot
)

# User prompt
prompt = "Hello, how are you?"
response = chat.get_response(prompt=prompt)
print(response)
```

### Whats new in 0.1.4?
- Implemented a new method for creating chats while ensuring backward compatibility with the existing system.
- Enhanced the Bot's capabilities by enabling it to remember the user's name along with its own.
