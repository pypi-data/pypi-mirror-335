# Super Simplex

## Description

A Python conversion of OpenSimplex2S / SuperSimplex from KdotJPG's implementation.

## Installation

Use this command on your terminal: `pip install super-simplex`

There are no dependencies required yet.

## Usage

For 2D noise:

```python
import super_simplex

x, y = 0.1, 0.2
seed = 314714837

# For standard simplex lattice
noise = super_simplex.noise_2d(x, y, seed)

# For rotated simplex lattice
noise = super_simplex.noise_2d_rotated(x, y, seed)
```

For 3D noise:

```python
import super_simplex

x, y, z = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3
seed = 314714837

# Rotated simplex lattice, y as the vertical axis
noise = super_simplex.noise_3d_xyz(x, y, z, seed)

# Rotated simplex lattice, z as the vertical axis
noise = super_simplex.noise_3d_xzy(x, z, y, seed)
```

For 4D noise:

```python
import super_simplex

x, y, z, w = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4
seed = 314714837

# Rotated simplex lattice, y as the vertical axis
noise = super_simplex.noise_4d_xyzw(x, y, z, w, seed)

# Rotated simplex lattice, z as the vertical axis
noise = super_simplex.noise_4d_xzyw(x, z, y, w, seed)
```
