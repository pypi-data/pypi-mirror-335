    Images are received in an own thread, which lives as long as the context
    manager.

    Yields a ``Queue`` instance.  Each time a frame is complete, it is put on
    the queue. Items are bytes instances.

    The queue buffers at most 5 frames, then it starts dropping the oldest frame
    on each new one.

    If another thread does heavy work (say, displaying an image :-)), it can
    happen that UDP packets are missed and JPG data would be corrupt. The
    receiver detects this and drops corrupt frames.
