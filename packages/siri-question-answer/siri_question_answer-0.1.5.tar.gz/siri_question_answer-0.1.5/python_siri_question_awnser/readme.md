# SIRI Real-Time Data Consumer

A Python library for consuming multiple SIRI (Service Interface for Real-Time Information) data feeds, including:
- Estimated Timetables (available)
- Vehicle Monitoring (not available)
- Stop Monitoring (not available)
- Situation Exchange (SX) (not available)
- General Messages (not available)

Provides real-time updates from public transportation APIs using the SIRI standard. Part of the `siri_question_answer` ecosystem.

## Installation

```bash
pip install siri_question_answer
```

## Features

### Supported SIRI Services
| Consumer Class                 | Description                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `EstimatedTableConsumer`       | Estimated arrival/departure times    |
| `VehicleMonitoringConsumer`    | Real-time vehicle positions          |
| `StopMonitoringConsumer`       | Stop-centric arrival predictions     |
| `SituationExchangeConsumer`    | Service disruptions/alerts           |
| `GeneralMessageConsumer`       | Text-based service notifications     |

## Usage

### Basic Implementation
```python
from siri_question_answer import EstimatedTableConsumer

def on_message(message: str, _type: str, id: str) -> None:
    print(f"Id {id}")
    print(f"Type {_type}")
    print(f"Message {message}")

# Create a new EstimatedTableConsumer
consumer = EstimatedTableConsumer(url="https://api.ginko.voyage/Siri/Siri.do?apiKey=blabla")
consumer.listen_estimated_timetable(60, on_message)

# For demonstration - use any appropriate way to keep the program alive
import time
while True:
    time.sleep(1)
```
