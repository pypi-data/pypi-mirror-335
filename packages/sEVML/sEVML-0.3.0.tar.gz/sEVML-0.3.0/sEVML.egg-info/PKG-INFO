# sEVML: Small Extracellular Vesicles Machine Learning Toolkit

A Python toolkit developed by the **INSERM U1231 HSPpathies** team for the analysis of ELISA-based datasets from small extracellular vesicles (sEVs).

## Overview

`sEVML` is designed to facilitate the preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation of machine learning pipelines based on ELISA data. It is optimized for the classification of biomarkers measured from sEVs.

Key features:
- Preprocess ELISA datasets (pivot, clean, normalize)
- Train XGBoost models with hyperparameter tuning
- Visualize learning and validation curves
- Evaluate model performance with ROC curves and confusion matrices
- Interpret feature importance using SHAP values

## Installation

To install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies include:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- shap

## Usage

```python
from sevml import (
    preprocess_elisa_dataset,
    train_xgb_with_gridsearch,
    evaluate_model,
    plot_model_curves,
    plot_shap_explanations
)

# Load and preprocess dataset
label_mapping = {"S": 0, "PD": 1}
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = preprocess_elisa_dataset("path/to/data.csv", label_mapping)

# Train model
model, params = train_xgb_with_gridsearch(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model
evaluate_model(model, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)

# Visualize curves
plot_model_curves(model, X_train, y_train)

# SHAP explanations
plot_shap_explanations(X_test, model, df_features)
```

## API Reference

### preprocess_elisa_dataset(filepath, label_mapping, test_size=0.2, random_state=5)
- Loads a raw ELISA CSV dataset.
- Pivots biomarker data to wide format.
- Imputes missing values (median).
- Scales features using MinMax.
- Splits data into training and testing sets.

### train_xgb_with_gridsearch(X, y, eval_metric='logloss', random_state=5, cv=3)
- Trains an XGBoost classifier.
- Performs grid search over hyperparameters.
- Returns best model and parameters.

### evaluate_model(model, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)
- Plots ROC curves and confusion matrices.
- Computes AUC, accuracy, and F1 scores.

### plot_model_curves(...)
- Plots learning and validation curves.
- Helpful for diagnosing under/overfitting.

### plot_shap_explanations(X, model, df_features)
- Uses SHAP to explain model predictions.
- Generates multiple plots: heatmap, violin, beeswarm, bar, waterfall.
