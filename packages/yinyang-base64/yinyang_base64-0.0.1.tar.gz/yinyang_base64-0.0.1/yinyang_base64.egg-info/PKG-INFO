## YinYang (陰陽)

A dualistic concept describing how seemingly opposite forces are interconnected and interdependent.

Yīn/Yam1 (陰): Represents darkness, femininity, cold, passivity, and the moon.

Yáng/Yeung4 (陽): Represents light, masculinity, heat, activity, and the sun.

Everything in the universe contains both Yīn and Yáng, and they constantly interact to maintain balance.

### 天干 (Tin1 Gon1) – The Ten Heavenly Stems

A system of ten characters used in combination with the Earthly Branches to form the Sexagenary Cycle (60-year cycle).

The ten stems are: 甲(Gaap3), 乙(Yut3), 丙(Bing2), 丁(Ding1), 戊(Mou6), 己(Gei2), 庚(Gang1), 辛(San1), 壬(Yam4), 癸(Gwai3).

Each stem is associated with an element from the Five Elements (五行, Ng5 Hang4) and is either Yīn/Yam1(陰) or Yáng/Yeung4(陽).

### 地支 (Dei6 Ji1) – The Twelve Earthly Branches

A system of twelve characters used in the Chinese calendar, astrology, and zodiac system.

The twelve branches correspond to the Chinese zodiac animals:

子(Ji2) – Rat, 丑(Chau2) – Ox, 寅(Yan4) – Tiger, 卯(Maau5) – Rabbit, 辰(San4) – Dragon, 巳(Ji6) – Snake, 午(Ng5) – Horse, 未(Mei6) – Goat, 申(San1) – Monkey, 酉(Yau5) – Rooster, 戌(Seut1) – Dog, 亥(Hoi6) – Pig.

Each branch is also linked to an element from the Five Elements and has a Yīn or Yáng attribute.

### 五行 (Ng5 Hang4) – The Five Elements

A system that describes interactions between elements in nature, used in feng shui, traditional Chinese medicine, astrology, and martial arts.

The five elements are:

Metal (金, Gam1) – Strength, structure

Wood (木, Muk6) – Growth, vitality

Water (水, Seui2) – Flexibility, wisdom

Fire (火, Fo2) – Energy, transformation

Earth (土, Tou2) – Stability, nourishment


The elements interact in two main cycles:

Generating (生, Sang1) cycle: Wood => Fire => Earth => Metal => Water => Wood.

Overcoming (剋, Hak1) cycle: Wood <= Earth <= Water <= Fire <= Metal <= Wood.
