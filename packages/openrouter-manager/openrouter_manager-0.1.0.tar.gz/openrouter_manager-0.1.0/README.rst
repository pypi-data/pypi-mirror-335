openrouter-manager
==================

**openrouter-manager** is a wrapper library for using **DeepSeek** with
**openrouter.ai**, facilitating integration with language models through
a simple and efficient API.

Main Features
-------------

- Wrapper for **DeepSeek** using **openrouter.ai**.
- Easy-to-use singleton class ``AiAgent``.
- Allows defining dynamic prompts with variables.
- Configuration via environment variables.

Installation
------------

It is recommended to install ``openrouter-manager`` in a virtual
environment to avoid dependency conflicts:

.. code:: bash

   pip install openrouter-manager

Requirements
------------

To use this library, the following environment
variables must be set:

- ``AIAGENT_API_KEY``: API Key for **openrouter.ai**.
- ``AIAGENT_PROMPT_FILE``: Path to the text file containing the prompt
  to send to the LLM.

Example configuration in a ``.env`` file:

.. code:: ini

   AIAGENT_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   AIAGENT_PROMPT_FILE="path/to/prompt_file.txt"

Usage 
-----

To use ``openrouter-manager``, first instantiate ``AiAgent``
and then call the ``resolve`` method, providing the necessary variables
to populate the prompt:

.. code:: python

   from openrouter_manager import AiAgent

   # Get the singleton instance of the agent
   agent = AiAgent()

   # Resolve the prompt with dynamic variables
   response = agent.resolve({"name": "John", "age": 30})

   print(response)  # Response generated by the LLM
