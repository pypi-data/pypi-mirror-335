Condor is a new mathematical modeling framework for Python, developed at
NASA's Ames Research Center. Initial development began in April 2023 to
address model implementation challenges for aircraft synthesis and
robust orbital trajectory design. The goal is for Condor to help
evaluate numerical models and then get out of the way.

One key aspect to achieve this goal was to create an API that looked as
much like the mathematical description as possible with as little
distraction from programming cruft as possible. To best understand
this approach, we can consider a simple benchmark problem which consists
of a set of coupled algebraic expressions. This can be represented as a
system of algebraic equations:

.. code-block:: python

  class Coupling(co.AlgebraicSystem):
      x = parameter(shape=3)
      y1 = variable(initializer=1.)
      y2 = variable(initializer=1.)

      residual(y1 == x[0] ** 2 + x[1] + x[2] - 0.2 * y2)
      residual(y2 == y1**0.5 + x[0] + x[1])

This parametric model can be evaluated by providing the values for the
parameters; the resulting object has values for its inputs and outputs
bound, so the solved values for ``y1`` and ``y2`` can be accessed easily:

.. code-block:: python

   coupling = Coupling([5., 2., 1]) # evaluate the model numerically
   print(coupling.y1, coupling.y2) # individual elements are bound numerically
   print(coupling.variable) # fields are bound as a dataclass

Models can also be seamlessly built-up, with parent models accessing any
input or output of models embedded within them. For example, we can
optimize this system of algebraic equations by embedding it within an
optimization problem:

.. code-block:: python

  class Sellar(co.OptimizationProblem):
      x = variable(shape=3, lower_bound=0, upper_bound=10)
      coupling = Coupling(x)
      y1, y2 = coupling

      objective = x[2]**2 + x[1] + y1 + exp(-y2)
      constraint(y1 >= 3.16)
      constraint(24. >= y2)

After the model is solved, the embedded model can be accessed directly:

.. code-block:: python

   Sellar.set_initial(x=[5,2,1])
   sellar = Sellar()
   print(sellar.objective) # scalar value
   print(sellar.constraint) # field
   print(sellar.coupling.y1) # sub-model element

NASA's Condor is a framework for mathematical modeling of engineering
systems in Python, written for engineers with a deadline.
