def get_self_correlating_frequencies(timesteps, signal):
    """
    Calculate the self-correlating frequencies in a signal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    timesteps : ndarray
        An array of uniformly spaced timesteps, corresponding to the time intervals
        between samples in the signal.
    signal : ndarray
        The input signal to analyze.

    Returns
    -------
    frequencies : ndarray
        An array of self-correlating frequencies, in units of inverse timesteps.

    Notes
    -----
    This function calculates the autocorrelation of the input signal,
    and finds the local maxima in the autocorrelation signal.
    These local maxima correspond to the self-correlating frequencies in the signal.
