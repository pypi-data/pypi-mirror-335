**Numerical Test Rig for Cascades.**


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://ntrfc.readthedocs.io.
* NTRfC is the base of the (NTRFlows)[https://gitlab.uni-hannover.de/tfd_public/tools/NTRFlows] repository, a workflow for cfd parameter studies



**Features**

Easy geometry and post-processing visualization and manipulation with pyvista.
Tested methods and functions for math, time-series, and mesh quality analysis.

**Dependencies**

- libgl1-mesa-glx (graphics driver)
- xvfb (virtual Display)
- libglu1-mesa (gmsh dependency)
- libxcursor1 (gmsh dependency)
- libxinerama1 (gmsh dependency)
- libxft2 (gmsh dependency)

Python requirement is Python>=3.10. Current NTRfC versions are based on Python 3.11. Only versions <v0.1.0 can be used with older versions of Python. Library requirements will be installed with the package itself.
Installation

NTRfC is utilizing powerful and complex dependencies like pyvista,open3d and gmsh. We strongly recommend using virtual or conda environments for installation.

For more information, see:

    virtualenv: https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/
    miniconda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
    anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html
    mamba: https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html


**Installation**

Installation from pypi


    pip install ntrfc




Installation from gitlab with pip


    pip install git+https://gitlab.uni-hannover.de/tfd_public/tools/NTRfC.git


Installation from source

After cloning the repository, go to the project root dir and type


    python setup.py install


Editable installation from source with pip

After cloning the repository, go to the project root dir and type


    pip install -e .


This way you have NTRfC installed but the code is not installed, but linked to the source-code.
You don't have to reinstall the package after your edits.
This speeds up testing and will lead to less debugging time.

**Singularity releases**

Use a singularity container from ntrfc singularity releases:  https://cloud.sylabs.io/library/nyhuma/ntrflows/ntr.sif].
The containers will come with a virtual graphics card and a xvfb display-server, enabling you to render on hpc-systems and any other unprepared system with limited graphics capability.
