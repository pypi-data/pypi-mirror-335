    Compute the skewness of a set of points.

    The skewness is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : numpy array
        The points of the cell, represented as a 2D array with shape (n, 3),
        where n is the number of points and the columns are the x, y, and z
        coordinates.

        The skewness of the points.
