# Report
The goal is to get a Docker Compose YAML file properly running in GitHub Actions for the AI-Price-Crawler repository. Initial attempts to verify the existence of a `docker-compose.yaml` file using the `gh` CLI failed due to invalid commands (`gh repo view` with `--name` and the non-existent `gh repo list-files`). Consequently, the repository was cloned locally using `git clone https://github.com/JoshuaSeth/AI-Price-Crawler.git` to list files, but this failed due to a "Connection lost" error. Retrying the clone and list operation produced the same error. The AI-Price-Crawler project comprises a crawler, a product matcher, a match-dependent operations service, and a Meilisearch adder service, utilizing a PostgreSQL database and Meilisearch for indexing; the crawler extracts product data, the product matcher identifies similar products, the match-dependent operations service executes operations on matched products, and the Meilisearch adder service adds matched product data to the Meilisearch index.


# Report


The goal is to get a docker compose yaml properly running in gh actions for the AI-Price-Crawler github repo. The plan involves verifying if a `docker-compose.yaml` file exists in the repository, creating one if it doesn't, and then setting up a GitHub Actions workflow to run the Docker Compose file. An attempt was made to check for the file's existence using the command `gh repo view JoshuaSeth/AI-Price-Crawler --name docker-compose.yaml`, but this resulted in an error because the `--name` flag is not a valid option for the `gh repo view` command.
 Overview


The AI-Price-Crawler project unifies services for crawling, matching, and indexing product data, enabling instant search functionality using a PostgreSQL database (SQLModel) and Meilisearch. The core services include a Scrapy-based crawler (`crawl.py`) for data extraction, a product matcher (`matcher/get_matches.py`) employing BERT-based similarity and optional vector stores, a match-dependent operations service (`run_match_dependent_operations_service.py`) for data enrichment, and a Meilisearch adder service (`meilisearch_adder_service.py`) for real-time indexing.

The crawler extracts data based on configurations found in `crawler/crawler/settings.py` and uses spiders defined in `crawler/crawler/spiders/spider.py`. The product matcher uses environment variables to configure the BERT model path (`CLASSIFIER_MODEL_PATH`), classification threshold (`CLASSIFICATION_THRESHOLD`), and vector store usage (`USE_VECTOR_STORE`). The match-dependent operations service polls the database based on the `MATCH_OPS_POLL_INTERVAL` environment variable, while the Meilisearch adder service uses `MEILISEARCH_HOST` and `MEILISEARCH_API_KEY` for configuration. The database connection is configured via the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, with migrations managed by Alembic.

The data flow involves the crawler storing data in PostgreSQL, the product matcher identifying similar products, the match dependent operations service performing match-dependent tasks, and the Meilisearch adder indexing the data.

To set up the project, one must clone the repository, create a virtual environment, install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`, configure the database and Meilisearch with appropriate environment variables, run database migrations (`alembic upgrade head`), and start each of the services using the specified commands (e.g., `./run_crawler.sh`, `python matcher/get_matches.py`).

Troubleshooting tips include verifying database and Meilisearch connection settings, ensuring the BERT model path is correct, and checking logs for errors. Contribution guidelines emphasize following coding style, writing clear commit messages, submitting pull requests with detailed descriptions, and including unit tests.
