# Report

## Command Output
The AI-Price-Crawler repository was explored to locate a `docker-compose.yaml` file, starting from the `/Users/sethvanderbijl/PitchAI Code/agents` directory. An initial listing (`ls -la`) revealed directories such as `.git`, `afasask`, `agent`, `chat`, `code_ops`, `gpt`, `prompts`, `server`, and `utils`, along with files like `.env`, `.gitignore`, `poetry.lock`, and `pyproject.toml`, but no `docker-compose.yaml` was immediately visible. Suspecting the current directory was not the repository root, the command `cd ../.. && find . -name "docker-compose.yaml"` was executed to navigate up two levels and search for the file. This resulted in numerous "Operation not permitted" errors while traversing directories like `Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary` and various Library subfolders, and ultimately failed due to a lost connection, thus the location of `docker-compose.yaml` remains unknown. Further investigation may be necessary to confirm the existence and location of a Docker Compose file within the repository, potentially using the GitHub CLI.
