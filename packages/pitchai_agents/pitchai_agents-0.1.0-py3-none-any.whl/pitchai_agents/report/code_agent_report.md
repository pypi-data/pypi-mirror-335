## Analysis and Execution


The last 3 commit messages for the AI-Price-Crawler repository were successfully retrieved using `gh api` and `jq`. The retrieved messages were: 1. mark subproject commits as dirty and comment out tests in various files; 2. remove test database, update .gitignore to exclude code directory, and mark subproject commits as dirty; 3. remove redundant README tests and mark subproject commits as dirty. An attempt to format the output and provide a summary by calling the `complete_analysis` function failed due to a `NameError` because the function was not defined.
