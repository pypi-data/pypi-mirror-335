# Report
The AI-Price-Crawler project utilizes several services for crawling, matching, and indexing product data, using a PostgreSQL database (SQLModel) and Meilisearch. The project architecture involves a crawler (`crawl.py`) leveraging Scrapy, a product matcher (`matcher/get_matches.py`) employing BERT-based similarity, a match dependent operations service (`run_match_dependent_operations_service.py`), and a Meilisearch adder service (`meilisearch_adder_service.py`). Data flows from the crawler to the PostgreSQL database (configured via the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable), then to the product matcher, the match dependent operations service, and finally to Meilisearch. To ascertain if Docker Compose is used and whether GitHub Actions workflows are in place, an initial attempt to view the repository `JoshuaSeth/AI-Price-Crawler` using `gh repo view` was made, but did not explicitly confirm the existence of a `docker-compose.yml` file or the usage of GitHub Actions. A subsequent attempt to list the repository files using `gh repo view JoshuaSeth/AI-Price-Crawler --template "{{ range .Files }}{{.Path}}\n{{end}}"` failed with exit code 1, preventing file structure retrieval. Given the failure to list files remotely, and to determine if `docker-compose.yml` and GitHub Actions are utilized for the AI-Price-Crawler project, the repository was cloned onto the production server at `37.27.67.52` using the command `ssh -i ~/.ssh/github-actions-hetzner root@37.27.67.52 "git clone https://github.com/JoshuaSeth/AI-Price-Crawler.git && ls -la AI-Price-Crawler && find AI-Price-Crawler -name docker-compose.yml -o -path '*/.github/workflows/*'"` in order to list files and search for `docker-compose.yml` and workflow files. The command output resulted in an error: "Error getting current directory: Failed to write to subprocess: Connection lost". The use of Docker Compose and GitHub Actions remains to be definitively confirmed.


## Error Analysis
The goal is to verify the correct operation of the `docker-compose.yml` file in GitHub Actions for the `AI-Price-Crawler` repository. Initial attempts to connect to the production server (37.27.67.52) via SSH to clone the repository and list files failed, resulting in a consistent "Connection lost" error. The command `ssh -i ~/.ssh/github-actions-hetzner root@37.27.67.52 "ls -la /"` specifically failed with "Failed to write to subprocess: Connection lost" and "Error getting current directory: Failed to write to subprocess: Connection lost". Considering the persistent SSH connection failures, a decision was made to use the GitHub API to gather information about the repository's contents, specifically searching for the `docker-compose.yml` file and files within the `.github/workflows` directory. However, the `gh api /repos/JoshuaSeth/AI-Price-Crawler/contents` command also failed with the same "Connection lost" error, indicating a fundamental problem with the SSH connection itself or a more severe, underlying network or server issue preventing successful command execution. The continued "Connection lost" errors suggest a connectivity problem that transcends specific commands and requires further investigation.
