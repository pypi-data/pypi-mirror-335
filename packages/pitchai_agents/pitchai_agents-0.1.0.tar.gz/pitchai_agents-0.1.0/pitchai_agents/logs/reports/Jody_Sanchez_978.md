# Report
The report investigates the AI-Price-Crawler repository (https://github.com/JoshuaSeth/AI-Price-Crawler), a private repository owned by JoshuaSeth, created on 2025-02-04 and last updated on 2025-03-10, to determine if a Docker Compose file is present and properly running within its GitHub Actions setup. The initial approach involved using the GitHub API to list the contents of the repository, specifically searching for a `docker-compose.yaml` file in the root directory, using the command `gh api repos/JoshuaSeth/AI-Price-Crawler/contents`. However, both the initial attempt and a subsequent retry to list the repository contents resulted in "Connection lost" errors, preventing the determination of the Docker Compose file's presence and its proper execution within GitHub Actions.
