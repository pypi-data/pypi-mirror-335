Within 2 years we'll move to the Netherlands so we probably can't take the car then. We'll private use it at least 60% of the time. Do some deep research, investigating some subfacts and making some calculations. This means that we either have to sell or import the car to the Netherlands in 2 years. What is the cheapest option? What about buying vs leasing? Also considering what we would get when we sell it. As you can see many possible configuratins and options. Electric seems most dedictable but new or second hand? New has higher depreciation. What is tax optimal? Research deeply."
