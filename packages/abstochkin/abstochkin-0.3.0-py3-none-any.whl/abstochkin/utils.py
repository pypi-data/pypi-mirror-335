    Compute the coefficient of determination, $R^2$.

    In the case of comparing the average AbStochKin-simulated species
    trajectory to its deterministic trajectory. Since the latter is only
    meaningful for a homogeneous population, R² should be
    close to `1` for a simulated homogeneous process.
    For a heterogeneous process, it can be interpreted as how close
    the simulated trajectory is to the deterministic trajectory of a
    *homogeneous* process. In this case, $R^2$ would not be expected
    to be close to $1$ and the importance of looking at this metric
    is questionable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    actual : numpy.array
        Actual data obtained through a simulation.
    theoretical : numpy.array
        Theoretical data to compare the actual data to.

    """
    Convert a kinetic parameter value from macroscopic to microscopic form.

    The ABK algorithm uses microscopic kinetic constants, thus necessitating
    the conversion of any molar quantities to their microscopic counterpart.
    For a kinetic parameter, the microscopic form is interpreted as the number
    of transition events per second (or whatever the time unit may be).
    For a molar quantity, its microscopic form is the number of particles in
    the given volume.

    Parameters
    ----------
    macro_val : float or int
        The value of the parameter to be converted, expressed in terms of
        molar quantities.
    volume : float or int
        The volume, in liters, in which the process that the given parameter
        value is a descriptor of.
    order : int, default: 0
        The order of the process whose kinetic parameter is to be converted.
        The default value of 0 is for parameters (such as Km or K50) whose
        units are molarity.
    inverse : bool, default: False
        Perform the inverse of this operation. That is, convert
        from microscopic to macroscopic form.

    Returns
    --------
    float
        A kinetic parameter is returned in units of reciprocal seconds.
        A molar quantity is returned as the number of particles in the
        given volume.

    Notes
    -----
    - A kinetic parameter for a 1st order process will remain unchanged
    because its units are already reciprocal seconds.
