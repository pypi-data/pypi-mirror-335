    """
    Anomaly detector based on K-nearest neighbors [ramaswamy2000efficient]_.

    Given some distance metric :math:`dist`, the :math:`K`-nearest neighbor of an
    instance :math:`x` is the sample :math:`y` such that there exist exactly :math:`K-1`
    other samples :math:`z` with :math:`dist(x, z) < dist(x, y)`. The :math:`K`-nearest neighbor
    distance of :math:`x` equals the distance to this :math:`K`the nearest neighbor.
    The larger this :math:`K`-nearest neighbor distance of a sample is, the further
    away it is from the other instances. :math:`K`-nearest neighbor uses this distance
    as an anomaly score, and thus detects distance-based anomalies.

    Notes
    -----
    The K-nearest neighbors inherets from :py:class:`~dtaianomaly.anomaly_detection.PyodAnomalyDetector`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    window_size: int or str
        The window size to use for extracting sliding windows from the time series. This
        value will be passed to :py:meth:`~dtaianomaly.anomaly_detection.compute_window_size`.
    stride: int, default=1
        The stride, i.e., the step size for extracting sliding windows from the time series.
    **kwargs
        Arguments to be passed to the PyOD isolation forest.

    Attributes
    ----------
    window_size_: int
        The effectively used window size for this anomaly detector
    pyod_detector_ : KNN
        A K-nearest neighbors detector of PyOD
