def sliding_window(train, window_size=2, horizon=1):
    '''
    Time series sliding window

    Transforms a univariate time series into a
    supervised learning problem with features and
    target vectors. Features are lagged observations
    in the series with lag_max = window_size.  The
    target vector is of size horizon.

    Parameters:
    -----------

    train: array-like
        training data for time series method

    window_size: int, optional (default=2)
        lookback - the maximum lag to include in the
        features.

    horizon: int, optional (default=1)
        number of observations ahead to predict

    Returns:
    -------
        array-like, array-like

        preprocessed X, preprocessed Y
