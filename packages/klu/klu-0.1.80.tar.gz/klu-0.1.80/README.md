## Description

The Klu Python SDK is a library that provides access to the Klu platform. With the SDK, quick build AI-enabled apps.

The SDK gives developers the ability to interact with their workspace, including:

- **klu.apps** Managing apps (projects) 
- **klu.actions** Manage actions (prompt templates with model config) 
- **klu.context** Create and manage context libaries for retrieval (RAG) or search
- **klu.actions.stream** Deploy actions for generations and chat
- **klu.session** Manage session memory across inference and models
- **klu.feedback** Capture user feedback and behavior
- **klu.experiment** Run 1:1 prompt evals and A/B tests
- **klu.data** Import JSONL data for use, or export for further analysis
- **klu.models** Manage LLM providers and default models
- **klu.finetune** Fine-tune models with on your data

## Installation

To install, run:

```
pip install klu
```

Klu SDK requires Python version 3.7 or later.

## Getting Started

To access Klu via the SDK, first obtain your API key from the [Klu.ai app](https://app.klu.ai/current/settings/developers). Once you have your key, you can create a `Klu` object:

```python
from klu import Klu

klu = Klu("YOUR_API_KEY")
```

### Manage Models

Once you have a `Klu` object, you can access the different models available in the Klu API:

```python
from klu import Klu

klu = Klu("YOUR_API_KEY")
models = await klu.models.get("model_guid")

```

### Get Apps

Each of these objects provides methods for interacting with the corresponding model in the Klu API. For example, to list all apps in your workspace, you can use:

```python
from klu import Klu

klu = Klu("YOUR_API_KEY")
apps = klu.apps.list()
```

### Run Actions w/ Streaming

Run inference with a Klu Action and start streaming generation response.

```python
from klu import Klu

klu = Klu("YOUR_API_KEY")

prompt_response = await klu.actions.prompt("action_guid", "prompt", streaming=True)
async for message in klu.actions.stream(prompt_response.streaming_url):
    print(message)
```

### Get Data

In a similar manner, in order to get a list of data points for an action, you can do the following:

```python
from klu import Klu

klu = Klu("YOUR_API_KEY")
data = klu.data.get_data("action_guid")
```

See the platform docs for more examples.
