# IPython Playground

I'm a big fan of playgrounds. Every repo should have a `playground.py` to make it easy to jump right
into REPL-driven development.

However, it's hard to understand what's in the `playground.py` once it gets big. This project eliminates this problem:

## Installation


```shell
pip install ipython-playground
```

## Usage

1. Run `ipython-playground` to generate a `playground.py`.  
2. Execute `./playground.py` to start an IPython session with additional setup.
